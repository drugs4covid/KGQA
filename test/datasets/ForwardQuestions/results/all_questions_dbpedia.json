In particular, a rabbit corneal cell line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP-rCF) and human corneal fibroblast (hCF) cell line successfully adhered to, proliferated through, and produced native matrix upon the optically transparent, self-standing silk film substrates.  The patterned film helped direct cell and actin filament alignment, and the hCF remained viable and fully proliferated the silk construct within ten days.  The silk film structures also exhibited potential to be used as scaffolding in tissue engineering applications, due to the initial native matrix that was produced.  Thus, studies have shown the viability of 3D fibroinbased structures to be used as corneal grafts and demonstrated the ability for such silk film constructs to serve as scaffolding for other tissue engineering purposes.  137 The drug content measured for each film from 10 random sites is also presented in Table 2 .

If filmmakers do seek consent from patients before filming, another problem confronts them.  To capture the sense of drama and life-threatening danger to which these shows aspire, patients who are approached for consent are often vulnerable and in a state of compromised decisionmaking capacity.

To obtain a progress measure, one starts from some suitable association of position of the game with measures.  The local information encoded by these measures is then propagated back along the edges of the underlying graph so as to associate with each position the information gathered along plays of some finite length starting from that position.  The propagation process is performed according to the following intuition.  The measures of positions adjacent to v are propagated back to v only if those measures push v further away from the property.  This propagation is achieved by means of a measure stretch operation +, which adds, when appropriate, the measure of an adjacent position to the weight of a given position.  This is established by comparing the measure of v with those of its adjacent positions, since, for each position v, the mean-payoff property is defined in terms of the sum of the weights encountered along the plays from that position", "time": 2.5761238749999995}

The DART mission will include sending a spacecraft to (65803) Didymos, a binary near-Earth asteroid system, and deliberately crashing it into the moonlet of the system to measure the amount of deflection achieved.  The moonlet (the smaller body of the Didymos two body system) is typical of the size of asteroids that pose a significant threat to Earth, and as such will provide NASA with valuable data they can use in the future when the need to deflect an asteroid arises.

{"ref_question": "What artist includes black star at the point of darkness in his work?", "ref_answers": "Paul Bowles", "answer": "Marlene Dumas", "score": 0.5232, "evidence": " She brings this point to introduce us into the work of South-African artist Marlene Dumas (based in Amsterdam) that created some of her artwork from medical photographs.  Gordon questions the assumption of photographic objectivity to \"suggest that there is greater complexity and interpretative scope in dermatological images than might initially be assumed\" [6] .  We hypothesized that artist gender may be associated with sentiment of automobile references, as discussed in \"Songs\" section.  Results on this point are mixed: the all else equal effect of a song being performed by a female artist(s) was negative and significant in one humananalyst model, and not significant in the other three models.  Although the work bound of Theorem 5. 1 for regular languages is strongly sublinear, one might aim for an even more work-efficient dynamic program, especially, since RangeMember(L) can be maintained sequentially with logarithmic update time for regular languages [9] .  We leave it as an open problem whether for every regular language L there is a DynFO-program for RangeMember(L) with a polylogarithmic work bound.  However, we show next that such programs exist for star-free regular languages, in fact they even have a logarithmic work bound.  The star-free languages are those that can be expressed by regular expressions that do not use the Kleene star operator but can use complementation.  It is well-known that star-free regular languages are just the regular languages that can be defined in first-order logic (without arithmetic!) [18] .  Readers might ask why we consider dynamic first-order maintainability of a problem that can actually be expressed in first-order logic.  The key point is the parallel work here: even though the membership problem for star-free languages can be solved by a parallel algorithm in time O(1), it inherently requires parallel work Ω(n).  According to the accounts provided by the artist at the time the work was produced, Fig.  63 represents thinking about new signage for the walking man and Figs.  64 and 65 , part of the practice of the artist in creating comics is a focus on wandering through landscapes and through the urban areas using abstract forms with the aim of developing self-direction in geography.

Figure 67 is a character the artist was developing.  The axioms should be coercive enough to force it to be the least fixed-point of the language map L → { } ∪ LK.

With their forelimbs adapted as wings, bats are the only mammals that are capable of sustained flight.  Echolocation enables bats to fly in dark places.  Bats have long finger-like bones in their wings, and hence are more maneuverable than the wings of birds.  However, unlike birds, they do not have a lot of lift.  Furthermore, the fact that they are nocturnally active helps them avoid direct competition with birds.  The ability to fly makes bats important vehicles for the dissemination of seeds and pollens, as well as viruses.  In 1950, the United States navy conducted an ill-advised experiment on the unsuspecting citizens of San Francisco [39] .  Large hoses sprayed out a fog of Serratia marcescens and Bacillus globigii to determine whether this kind of dispersal mechanism might be an effective way of exposing a large population to a biological warfare agent.  S.  marcescens and B.  globigii were used because these organisms were considered to be completely harmless.  From the viewpoint of the navy, this experiment was a success in that the bacteria were distributed widely over the Bay area, delivering a small dose of organisms to the target population.  In terms of genre, whilst many successful dramas are based upon blending (tragicomic, romantic-comedy, etc. ), and whilst genres can be shifted from one mode to another, genre constraint nevertheless exists, since genres are indeed generic and therefore do not exhibit unlimited plasticity or boundless synthetic potential.  This genre constraint might be thought of as one of the ways in which the relative 'autonomy of culture' functions.  During the initial low mimetic period, a growing proportion of the public may not have found the government's narrative genre convincing, but there was at least coherent projection to disagree with.  No such coherence reigned during this third period.  Bat wings often have hitch-hiking mites specialised for this somewhat unusual life style.

Smaller competitive markets are an advantage for local broadcast TV, because ads are more affordable to candidates and PACs and many congressional districts fall across multiple television markets, further benefitting the local TV option.  Local broadcast news is key, because its audience still comprises the highest density of voters.  Last but not least, local television stations can target audiences by program, time of day, and genre; local cable only targets by network, and the average cable interconnect reaches only about 44% of the television market.  Local television reaches all of the market-that is, all of the voters (Poor 2014).  As a result, local television newscasts were used for about half of all political ads, doubling the number of ads placed on other news programs such as cable, talk shows, etc.  We sampled newspapers, TV stations and radio stations for the study.  We wanted to make sure that we had a representation of different types of media so that our sample will be rich enough to enable us draw conclusion.  Therefore, we sampled two newspapers namely Nation and Daily Sun (both privately owned) and two TV stations namely Nigerian Television Authority (government owned) and Channels Television (privately owned).  We also sampled two radio stations namely Dream Fm (privately owned) and Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (government owned).  It should be noted that there are no national daily newspapers in Nigeria that are owned by the government.  That is why there was no government newspaper in the sample selected.  We combined both stratify and simple random sampling to select the media houses studied.  Therefore, two attributes were used to guide our stratification.  They are ownership and media genre.  The ownership structures considered were private and government ownership.  The media genres considered were newspapers, TV and radio.  After the stratification, we randomly sampled the media houses, making sure that all the strata were dully represented.  This means that our sample of the media examined was rich in terms of the representation of media with different features.

The truth is that there is no steadfast rule anymore, and any answer will depend on the genre in which an artist situates themselves and the type (and size) of audience they hope to reach.  The system involves converting the sounds of a paintbrush striking a canvas and the painting itself in order to select and play out a musical track.  This involves drawing a correspondence between visual and sound worlds.  In order to associate visual and sound systems, we chose to train a deep neural network to learn to map album cover art with their corresponding sound clip.  Our reasoning was that album art contains a diverse representation of elements of the visual world, and a stylistically varied mixture of abstraction and realism.  Care is given to each music albums cover to make the album art stylistically representative of the emotions, contents, and the aesthetics of the music which other sources often do not capture (e. g. , a music video).

The study period started with the initiation of active influenza surveillance by the GROG network, i. e. , 15 days after the beginning of the influenza vaccination campaign, and finished at the end of the influenza period defined as the last week with at least one swab positive for influenza within the GROG network.  Laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in France excluding Corsica and overseas territories were reported by physicians from the Regional Groups of Influenza Observation (GROG) as part of a surveillance routine.  GROG is a network of private-practice GP and pediatricians dedicated to the virological surveillance of influenza [9] .  Corsican laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported by Sentinelles GPs [10] .  Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected through a randomized selection routine.  Doctors included the first patient of each week, of any age (Sentinelles protocol) or of a personally assigned age group among 0-4, 5-14, 15-64, and $65 year-old (GROG protocol).  Only patients presenting between 0 and 7 days after symptom onset were swabbed.  ''Ad hoc'' sampling Patients from which swabs were taken were selected by the GROG practitioners during the study period.  Data on cases and controls were collected by the practitioners using a standardized questionnaire adapted from the I-Move study.  Questionnaires were sent by the practitioners with the swab to the virology laboratory, and sent to the GROG national coordination.  Data entry and validation were ensured by Open Rome through the Vircases computing tool.  Validation steps included control of exhaustiveness of centralization of questionnaires, comparison of data entered by the labs and the national GROG coordination, coherence control, and identification of missing data.

[26] reported that TiO 2 nanoparticles could kill the mammalian cells via reactive oxygen species generated by photocatalysis, while Kommireddy et al.  [142] revealed that TiO 2 thin film could speed the spread of mouse mesenchymal stem cells owing to the rough surface.  The published literature shows that ZnO nanoparticles have been applied to drug delivery and cosmetics with nontoxicity [143] , while Hanley et al.  [144] demonstrated that ZnO nanoparticles could kill cancerous T cells owing to the generation of ROS.  Huang et al.  [145] also reported the cytotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles with the size of 20 nm against human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was concentration-and time-dependent, resulting from elevating oxidative stress, disturbing calcium homeostasis and causing membrane damage.  However, ZnO nanoparticles were considered and generally recognized as safe (GRAS) material by FDA [146] .  We can also use the JISL 1902-1998 rule to estimate the antibacterial effectiveness of the defective TiO x (x b 2) photocatalyst thin film.  This rule has been used for estimating the toxicity of novel drugs.  At present, PV technology is classified into the Si-wafer technology (the first generation), thin-film technology (the second generation) and multi-junction technology (the third generation) [103] .  To be more specific, the first generation of solar cell technology utilized silicon as the semiconductor for producing p-type and n-type layers, however it has the demerits of low efficiency and high cost.  To overcome the drawback, the thin-film solar cells are developed and fabricated to produce power energy and decrease current losses.  Compared to the traditional silicon semiconductor solar cell, the thin-film solar cells have only a few micro-meter layer thickness and more flexible installation.  And also, it uses less material and lower cost for manufacturing processes that are relied on various of chemical substances involving the a-Si, CIGS, CdTe and GaAs.  Compare with the first and second generations of solar cells, the third generation (multi-junction technology) is the introduction of nanotechnology and organic materials into the manufacturing process, but it is still in the research and development (R&D) phase and yet to be commercially applied [105] .  There are currently five types of organic or polymer (OPV); dye-sensitized (DSSC), copper zinc tin sulphide solar cell (CZTS), quantum dot solar cell and perovskite solar cell [106] [107] [108] .  Comparison between various types of solar cells is represented in Table 12 .  Succeeding generations demonstrated increased efficacy.

The results of the home production model suggest that a social insurance system should provide goods used intensively in home production in-kind if goods and labor are substitutes in home production.  Is this consistent with the form of in-kind benefits and empirical evidence on home production in the U. S. ? Turning first to the provision of goods, Fig.  1 gives data on the scale of various in-kind benefits provided by the U. S.  government in 2015.  This graph divides in-kind programs into the five broad categories presented in the U. S.  House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee's Green Book: education, healthcare, home energy assistance, housing assistance, and nutrition assistance.  6 Combined, spending on all such programs accounts for approximately 13% of GDP.  Turning to the individual program categories in the graph, the model presented in this paper is not applicable to spending on public education or healthcare.  Although one could plausibly argue that improving a person's health or offering them educational services should lead to higher output in home production, the effects of education and healthcare have traditionally been modeled as increasing labor productivity through human capital accumulation.  This would correspond to increasing the output of home production by increasing θ 2 rather than c 2 .  As the model takes productivity as exogenous, these effects are not captured.

Kaggle chest X-ray database contains 5863 chest X-ray images of normal, viral and bacterial pneumonia with varying resolutions [40] .  Out of these 5863 chest X-ray images, 1583 images are normal images and the remaining are bacterial and viral pneumonia images.  Sample X-ray images from QaTa-Cov19 dataset are shown in Fig.  6 .  Risk factors include prior residence in an endemic country, history of untreated TB, a chest x-ray which shows evidence of old healed TB, augmented immunosup-pression for rejection, use of T-cell depleting agents for immunosuppression and recipient age.  In emergency departments, chest X-ray, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) are widely used diagnostic imaging tests to identify COVID-19 pneumonia.  Which imaging test is available may depend on the type of hospital and available resources: a tertiary care hospital in a high-income country may have a mobile CT scan available, while in smaller hospitals only X-ray and ultrasound are accessible.  These imaging tests have the advantage that the condition of the lungs can be assessed visually.  Peru has been a leader regarding transparency in mining, and, therefore, we might expect that the Peruvian state would be better equipped to regulate foreign firms than some host countries.  The country joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2007 and was the first country to be assessed as compliant with the EITI 4 years later (Ray et al.  2015) .  In 2011, Peru enacted a law of prior consultation which stipulates that indigenous communities have the right to consultation before the state implements policies that would impact them, such as natural resource extraction (Ray et al.  2015) .

Moreover, people's tastes in film types also change with the market.  This study measures the dynamic influence of film types according to the average box office performance of the type of film in the past year.  Regarding the main story types of films, the genre classification is shown in Table 4 .   Effective features are the core of box office prediction.  Considering the availability of data and the predictive power of features, five pre-production factors are selected based on the film itself: genre, star value, release date, release area, and sequels.  This mix of editorials, commentary articles and testimonies opens up the question of academic genre, which is beyond the scope of this article.  Whatever the genre, however, Postdigital Science and Education strongly encourages experimentation and places experimental articles on equal footing with articles written using more traditional approaches.  The freedom to experiment is always restricted by a strong sense of responsibility for quality of published works.  Experimental articles are extensively discussed within the editorial board; good and bad outcomes are given equal attention.  Research on academic publishing itself is actively encouraged and supported.  Peru's insertion into the global marketplace since the Fujimori government (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) resulted in cinema following this same model.  The cuts to state funding implemented by the 1994 Cinema Law significantly reduced filmic production, prompting many filmmakers to insert themselves into the network of international film festival financing institutions (Barrow 2018, p.  29; Bedoya 2015, p.  54) .  Consequently, the technical standards and stylistic and thematic parameters of this global film market were imposed as necessary paths for success, especially for art films (Bedoya 2015, pp.  53, 61) .  In addition, the expansion of Peruvian consumer culture facilitated the emergence of privately owned and relatively successful commercial film companies with global models of style and genre for production, and standardized industrial systems for distribution and exhibition.  Few democratic countries, however, have utilized their home-grown films for nation branding due to the complex and unpredictable associations that overseas audiences could cultivate depending on the content of a particular film and how it could be interpreted.

Wildfire occur due to lightning, spontaneous combustion, sparks from rock falls, volcanic eruption, coal seam fires, cooking in forests, sparks from equipment discarded cigarettes, intentional fire by terrorist, shooting by poachers, preparation of forest land for agriculture by firing, and power line arcs.  During wild fire, burning logs can roll downhill igniting dried vegetation in lower elevation.  Dry climbers become fire ladders and burns trees.  Methane formed due to litter decomposition catches fire easily thereby spreading fire.  Lower precipitation, higher temperature, drop in humidity increases spread of fire.

Eritrea promulgated its first post-independence nationality law, formally known as the Eritrean Nationality Proclamation, in 1992 as part of preparations for the 1993 national referendum for independence.  Like Ethiopia, Eritrea also subscribes to the principle of jus sanguinis as the main guiding principle for the acquisition of nationality.  However, there is a major distinction between the two countries when it comes to the issue of dual nationality.  Paragraph 5 of Article 2 of the Eritrean nationality law exempts Eritrean citizens living abroad and who have obtained the nationality of other countries.  The law gives individuals the option of retaining their foreign nationality, provided they have a good reason to do so.  This approach is prompted by the following considerations.  However, it needs to be noted that the right to nationality recognised under Article 15(2) of the UDHR may also be subject to certain limitations, as noted for example, by the UN Secretary-General's thematic report on Human Rights and Arbitrary Deprivation of Nationality.  52 Under paragraph 8 of the same report, the Secretary-General recognises that nationality laws of countries may provide for the automatic loss of nationality in response to the voluntary acquisition of another nationality.  The document also recognises that while dual nationality is gaining increasing acceptance, it is still a commonplace that it is a ground for deprivation.  Citing the arbitral award of the EECC, the Secretary-General argues that there is no evident international norm regarding a right to dual nationality.  53 Ethiopia has one of oldest nationality laws in Africa, which is from 1930, predating its 1994 Constitution.  However, the 1994 Constitution itself (in Article 6) also briefly speaks about nationality, by way of providing a general principle, the details of which are left to \"be determined by law. \" The first paragraph of Article 6 of the Constitution is inspired by the well-known principle of jus sanguinis, 83 by which nationality is acquired based on ancestral background, namely: if one or both of the parents of an individual are Ethiopians.  This tends to be the most common practice in the civil law systems of continental Europe.  84 In contrast, other countries, and most notably the United States, are known for their propensity towards the principle of jus soli", "time": 2.7209454160000064}

First there was the Stone Age where hard fl int stone was sharpened by chipping away and honing the cutting edge on another fl int stone.  This resulted in a sharp cutting edge, which could be used as a knife, axe or spear tip.  The single-mirror coincident schlieren system at the Department of Building Physics at the Bauhaus-University Weimar consists of a concave spherical mirror with astronomical qualities, a light-emitting diode (LED) light source, a knife-edge schlieren cutoff, and a high-resolution digital camera (Canon EOS 5DS R) ( Fig.  1 left and Fig.  2) .  Prior to the volunteer tests, a Materials Testing System (MTS, Hounsfield Test equipment Ltd.  Each weapon was tested three times.  The blunt edge and tip radius as well as the blunt tip angle were calculated for each weapon.  During the investigations, the phase object (musician with instrument or singer) is placed in front of the mirror.  The diverging light ray emitted from the LED reaches the mirror and returns along the coincident path where it crosses the phase object, which is inducing the density gradient.  For coincident optics, the phase object is traversed twice by the same light ray.  Therefore, the distance between the light source and the knife-edge was kept at a minimum distance of 5 mm to avoid double imaging.  When passing through the density gradients, some rays are refracted.  If these rays are refracted downwards to the extent of ∆ , they are blocked by the knife-edge and, thus, create shadows in the image screen which constitutes the foreground of the schlieren image.  On the other hand, the light rays that are refracted over the knifeedge pass to the camera sensor and brighten the image screen which constitutes the background of the schlieren image (Gena et al.  2020) .  In these experiments, the knife-edge was at a position where it blocks approximately 50% of the refracted light rays.

A 1999 regulation defined \"public charge\" for admission and deportation purposes as one who is \"primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at government expense\" (64 Fed.  Reg.  28689).  Eritrea promulgated its first post-independence nationality law, formally known as the Eritrean Nationality Proclamation, in 1992 as part of preparations for the 1993 national referendum for independence.  Like Ethiopia, Eritrea also subscribes to the principle of jus sanguinis as the main guiding principle for the acquisition of nationality.  However, there is a major distinction between the two countries when it comes to the issue of dual nationality.  Paragraph 5 of Article 2 of the Eritrean nationality law exempts Eritrean citizens living abroad and who have obtained the nationality of other countries.  The law gives individuals the option of retaining their foreign nationality, provided they have a good reason to do so.  This approach is prompted by the following considerations.  However, it needs to be noted that the right to nationality recognised under Article 15(2) of the UDHR may also be subject to certain limitations, as noted for example, by the UN Secretary-General's thematic report on Human Rights and Arbitrary Deprivation of Nationality.  52 Under paragraph 8 of the same report, the Secretary-General recognises that nationality laws of countries may provide for the automatic loss of nationality in response to the voluntary acquisition of another nationality.  The document also recognises that while dual nationality is gaining increasing acceptance, it is still a commonplace that it is a ground for deprivation.  Citing the arbitral award of the EECC, the Secretary-General argues that there is no evident international norm regarding a right to dual nationality.  53 Ethiopia has one of oldest nationality laws in Africa, which is from 1930, predating its 1994 Constitution.  However, the 1994 Constitution itself (in Article 6) also briefly speaks about nationality, by way of providing a general principle, the details of which are left to \"be determined by law. \" The first paragraph of Article 6 of the Constitution is inspired by the well-known principle of jus sanguinis, 83 by which nationality is acquired based on ancestral background, namely: if one or both of the parents of an individual are Ethiopians.  This tends to be the most common practice in the civil law systems of continental Europe", "time": 2.3214237920000187}

In Jemisin's book, New York battles one of Lovecraft's monsters, which takes out the Williamsburg Bridge.  New York is injured in the process.  The avatars of the five New York City boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island) must find each other and, despite their occasional suspicion and dislike of each other, unite in order to save him and defend the city.  Maintaining a bell-like curve, we employed a circular radial chart to avoid path overlapping and to visually decouple the exterior genre count from the interior multi-genre coordinate position indicators.  This idea evolved when dot density was measured and used to form topographic contours with distinct shapes and coloring.  The resultant visual symbol serves as a unique personal \"logo\" or dataSelfie for each user and was further optimized for the comparative interpretation of a \"book of interest\" in the the How-it-fits visualization, by toggle-sorting genre count.  Sorting became an important first step of undoing the misleading side-effects of alphabetical ordering and for shifting contour alignments away from the circle center.

The literature on the upregulation of ADAMs in the CNS of MS patients is still in its infancy.  Cells of the immune system produce various ADAMs (REF.  48 ), and it is likely that several ADAMs will be elevated in the CNS during neuroinflammation and MS.  Also, with the exception of ADAM17 described above, much remains to be explored about the consequences of the aberrant expression of ADAMs in the CNS.  The catalytic activity and substrate selectivity of ADAMs has been explored using both biochemical and cell biological approaches.  One important conclusion from biochemical studies was that individual ADAMs do not have a clear consensus cleavage site in vitro.  Since ADAMs and their substrates are both membrane-anchored, cell-based assays are critical tools for understanding the substrate selectivity and regulation of ADAMs in the context of the plasma membrane.  Studies using cells from ADAM knockout mice, or cells treated with siRNA against different ADAMs, have revealed that these enzymes display substrate selectivity in cells, although the mechanism underlying this remains to be established.  A common feature, however, is that ADAMs frequently cleave their substrates close to the plasma membrane, resulting in release or \"ectodomain shedding\" of the substrate's soluble ectodomain (see above) ( Fig.  2 ).  Adams BD/Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA * * Dr.  Adams is currently affiliated with Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, TX.  In the case of ADAMs, less is known about the regulation of their activity.  Several ADAMs are kept in the inactive state through the interaction of a cysteine residue at the propeptide domain with zinc in the metalloproteinase module.  So, as with MMPs, these ADAMs might be activated by the cysteine switch mechanism that disrupts the cysteine-zinc interaction to expose the catalytic site.  ADAMs might also be regulated at the transcriptional level.  For example, interleukin-1 (IL-1) can induce transcription of some ADAM members.  Little is known of the physiological that lack metalloproteinase activity, this domain might fill another purpose, such as allowing protein-protein interactions.

Our work however differentiates from this study since we focus on capturing similarities between movie plots regardless of the genre they ultimately belong to.  The user preference matrix represents the users' preferences for the different genres of movies.  Since our goal is to provide the user with movie recommendations, the first step was to remove all ratings less than 3, 5.  If a user has not rated any movies with a rating greater or equal to 3, 5, the user is excluded from the procedure.  For every user, the total number of movies being watched, belonging to a particular genre, was counted.  In following, this count was divided by the total number of movies the user has watched.  Specifically, each matrix row represents a different user, each column corresponds to a different movie genre, and each cell defines the percentage of preference of that user towards that particular genre.  Entertainment Science scholars Dhar and Weinberg (2015) tested this argument with 26 years of weekly North American movie market data, and their results provide empirical evidence for the existence of such a counter-cyclical demand pattern.

The elasticity of consumer sentiment is −0. 32: a 10% decrease in sentiment leads to an increase in movie demand of about 3%, on average.  It seems plausible that different kinds of entertainment are affected to varying degrees, as they address more or less crisis-related motives (e. g. , are comedies a more intuitive choice than dramas in rough times?).

This culture was defined as 'the sum of the Danish People's history, experience, religion, language and common customs'.  8 The manifesto for example stated that Denmark should belong to the Danes.  The party argued that immigrants were parasites on the Danish welfare system, which, as result would be severely weakened-to the detriment of ethnic Danes, when in need of services.  Against this background, he, too, would see religion-here particularly Islam-as a barrier to a democratic citizenship regime.  In the Near Eastern context, Shafei has experienced the connection between religion and citizenship as fraught with tensions and inequality as the debate about it has become part and parcel of a 'politics of belonging' that creates 'insiders' and 'outsiders' (Yuval-Davis 2006) .  While in the European context, it is often Muslims that have been constructed as 'Others' (e. g.  Cesari 2013), in the Near Eastern context, it seems to be the non-Muslims (or non-practising Muslims) and 'their' concepts that have become the 'Other' within the rhetoric of the politics of belonging.  The discourse that Shafei describes is one that 'creates symbolic boundaries between those who allegedly belong and those who allegedly don't' (Nyhagen and Halsaa 2016: 61 ).  It appears that what Nyhagen and Halsaa (ibid. ) describe for Europe's past is valid for the present in the Near East: 'Religion has historically been used as a traditional boundary marker between people […].  Religion has also been used in various ways to instil terror in people's everyday lives'.  This experience is shared by Bouatta, who completes the picture from an Algerian perspective.  In Chap.  10, she uses the term 'Supermuslim' in the discussion of the politics of belonging that has been taking place in Algeria in recent decades.  For an apparently increasing number of Algerians, it has become necessary or relevant to identify as 'more Muslim than Muslim', that is, as particularly and openly devout.  Bouatta's experience shared in both of her contributions exemplifies the feminist debate about the significance of religion for feminist struggles.
