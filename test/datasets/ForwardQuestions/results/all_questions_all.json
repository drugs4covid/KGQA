The local information encoded by these measures is then propagated back along the edges of the underlying graph so as to associate with each position the information gathered along plays of some finite length starting from that position.  The propagation process is performed according to the following intuition.  The measures of positions adjacent to v are propagated back to v only if those measures push v further away from the property.  This propagation is achieved by means of a measure stretch operation +, which adds, when appropriate, the measure of an adjacent position to the weight of a given position.  This is established by comparing the measure of v with those of its adjacent positions, since, for each position v, the mean-payoff property is defined in terms of the sum of the weights encountered along the plays from that position.  The process ends when no position can be pushed further away from the property and each position is not dominated by any, respectively one, of its adjacents, depending on whether that position belongs to player ⊕ or to player , respectively.  The positions that did not reach measure ∞ are those from which player can win the game and the set of measures currently associated with such positions forms a mean-payoff progress measure.  Like in other logical games in the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé tradition, the attacker plays the conjunctions and universal quantifiers, whereas the defender plays the disjunctions and existential quantifiers.  For instance, (p, a ϕ) is declared as defender position, since a ϕ is meant to become true precisely if there exists a state p reachable p a → p where ϕ is true.  As every move strictly reduces the height of the formula, the game must be finite-depth (and cycle-free), and, for image-finite systems and formulas, also finite.  It is determined and the following semantics is total.  is false: No matter whether the defender plays to (b + d, ¬ d T) or to (c + d, ¬ d T), the attacker wins by moving to the stuck defender position (0, ¬T).

Currently slated to launch in late July of 2021, NASA's DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission is designed to test the capabilities of asteroid deflecting technology [6] .  The DART mission will include sending a spacecraft to (65803) Didymos, a binary near-Earth asteroid system, and deliberately crashing it into the moonlet of the system to measure the amount of deflection achieved.  The moonlet (the smaller body of the Didymos two body system) is typical of the size of asteroids that pose a significant threat to Earth, and as such will provide NASA with valuable data they can use in the future when the need to deflect an asteroid arises.  Asteroid hyalosis is a degenerative condition of the eye involving small white opacities in the vitreous.  It is known to occur in humans, dogs, cats, and chinchillas.  Clinically, these opacities are quite refractile, giving the appearance of stars (or asteroids) shining in the night sky.  Histologically, they present as round, amphophilic, laminated to radiating structures of variable size within the vitreous.  Asteroid hyalosis has been associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and, in dogs and cats, intraocular tumors.  In dogs, asteroid hyalosis is considered to be an age-related change.  Here we present rotationally resolved spectra of asteroid Phaethon beyond 2. 5-µm, which reveal no evidence for hydration on the surface of this asteroid.  Our results indicate that volatile sublimation and phyllosilicate devolatilization may not be the cause for Phaethon's modern activity.  Our conclusion supports the connection of Phaethon and the Pallas family.  We conducted a spectroscopic analysis of asteroid Phaethon, covering mostly its northern hemisphere and equatorial region, beyond 2. 5-µm to search for hydration evidence on asteroid (3200) Phaethon.  We measured 3-µm spectra, indicative of hydration, of Phaethon with the LXD mode of the SpeX Both asteroids have blue-sloped spectra in the 0. 5-2. 5 µm spectral region.

At present, it has widely appeared in film and television media, animation, art design and other fields\" [1] .  Both of these TV channels have tweeted a lot about case and its related issues from their official twitter accounts, but there is a significant disparity in the kind of response and viewership they received on their social media platforms.  Republic has been far more successful with the kind of content it has put out, as compared with India Today.  Here are some general trends we found in the material put out by both: However, my central concern is with the effects of information disorders.  I work on the premise that merely asserting that fake news causes harm is insufficient for understanding its insidiousness.  Misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation, while they differ concerning the intention of speaker, writer, and purveyor of fake news, all potentially have the same kind of effect on our imaginations.  Deceivers or unknowing spreaders of fake news are still perpetrators of the prolific dissemination of information disorders via the World Wide Web (WWW), television (TV), and other digital media worldwide.  Around the world, attempts to continue providing education to students varied greatly, due to significant differences in access to technologies, which could support remote teaching, such as books, TV, smartphones, and the internet.  For example, while children in Rwanda received pedagogical content through the use of radio, several countries, including Côte d'Ivoire, arranged TV classrooms, an initiative including taping lessons to be aired on national TV (Miks and McIlwaine, 2020) .  Many international providers of educational tools made their resources free of charge during the pandemic, and UNICEF launched the #LearningAtHome initiative, which provided activities every day that parents could adapt and share with others, given that they had internet access (Miks and McIlwaine, 2020) .  Although, little is known about what kind of schooling children actually took part in during the pandemic, it appears that most countries attempted to provide relevant tasks for children to do at home, often in combination with pedagogical content provided through TV, radio, or the internet.

The published literature shows that ZnO nanoparticles have been applied to drug delivery and cosmetics with nontoxicity [143] , while Hanley et al.  [144] demonstrated that ZnO nanoparticles could kill cancerous T cells owing to the generation of ROS.  Huang et al.  [145] also reported the cytotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles with the size of 20 nm against human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was concentration-and time-dependent, resulting from elevating oxidative stress, disturbing calcium homeostasis and causing membrane damage.  However, ZnO nanoparticles were considered and generally recognized as safe (GRAS) material by FDA [146] .  We can also use the JISL 1902-1998 rule to estimate the antibacterial effectiveness of the defective TiO x (x b 2) photocatalyst thin film.  This rule has been used for estimating the toxicity of novel drugs.  At present, PV technology is classified into the Si-wafer technology (the first generation), thin-film technology (the second generation) and multi-junction technology (the third generation) [103] .  To be more specific, the first generation of solar cell technology utilized silicon as the semiconductor for producing p-type and n-type layers, however it has the demerits of low efficiency and high cost.  To overcome the drawback, the thin-film solar cells are developed and fabricated to produce power energy and decrease current losses.  Compared to the traditional silicon semiconductor solar cell, the thin-film solar cells have only a few micro-meter layer thickness and more flexible installation.  And also, it uses less material and lower cost for manufacturing processes that are relied on various of chemical substances involving the a-Si, CIGS, CdTe and GaAs.  Compare with the first and second generations of solar cells, the third generation (multi-junction technology) is the introduction of nanotechnology and organic materials into the manufacturing process, but it is still in the research and development (R&D) phase and yet to be commercially applied [105] .  There are currently five types of organic or polymer (OPV); dye-sensitized (DSSC), copper zinc tin sulphide solar cell (CZTS), quantum dot solar cell and perovskite solar cell [106] [107] [108] .  Comparison between various types of solar cells is represented in Table 12 .  Succeeding generations demonstrated increased efficacy.  Ioannou (2007) shows that equilibrium DDAC adsorption (3rd generation) on microorganisms is significantly higher than that for ADBAC (first generation); DDAC appears to form multiple layers, or perhaps accumulation in the cells begins to happen at a lower concentration than for ADBAC.  Kill rates for ADBAC were also demonstrated to be significantly faster for DDAC than ADBAC.  Notably, a plateau was achieved in the kill/time curve, indicating that kill effectively stopped at a certain time point", "time": 65.90764583399982}
