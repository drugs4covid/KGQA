The cellular component annotation (GO-CC) revealed that the differentially expressed proteins were well distributed within different cell components, with intrinsic to membrane and organelle lumen being two highly distributed components (12 and 11 proteins, respectively) (Fig.  4A) .  The molecular function (GO-MF) annotation demonstrated that proteins related to cation binding, nucleotide binding and enzyme binding were most commonly affected by viral infection (Fig.  4B ).

"], "answer": "2", "confidence": 0.9337, "evidence": "Although similar in organization, the neck domains of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR differ in important respects.  For instance, the neck domain of DC-SIGNR is much more stable to thermal denaturation than the neck domain of DC-SIGN.  11 These differences presumably reflect the effects of differences in the sequences in the repeat units in the two receptors.  However, the way that individual differences in the neck domain repeat units affect the structure and stability of the neck domain has not been defined.  Force measurements of the extracellular portions of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are consistent with the presence of the 37-Å -long 23amino acid repeat units in an extended structure.  12, 13 However, no detailed structural information for the neck domain of DC-SIGN is available.  Each of the hybrid constructs formed tetramers, as judged by gel-filtration analysis, but differential scanning calorimetry revealed a range of stabilities (Fig.  4c) .  The greater stability associated with DC-SIGNR maps in the C-terminal half of the neck domain, as the major increase in stability occurs with introduction of the fifth repeat of DC-SIGNR into DC-SIGN.  The DC-SIGNR sequence in this repeat differs from the corresponding sequence in DC-SIGN only by the presence of leucine rather than glutamine at the first position in the heptad repeat.  Thus, the difference between the two proteins must reflect subtle differences in a relatively short region of the neck domain.  The difference emphasizes that although the two receptors diverged relatively recently in human evolution, they have evolved to fulfill different roles.  The differences in neck domain stability probably reflect differences in the packing of the four receptor subunits, particularly toward the C-terminal end, which in turn may affect the disposition of the CRDs and thus alter the way that these receptors interact with ligands on the surfaces of pathogens.  DC-SIGN and L-SIGN/DC-SIGNR genes have long been considered to share similar overall structure and ligandbinding characteristics.  However, biochemical and structural studies show that they have distinct ligand-binding properties and different physiological functions.  Of importance in both these genes is the presence of an extra-cellular domain consisting of an extended neck region encoded by tandem repeats that support the CRD, which plays a crucial role in influencing the pathogen-binding properties of these receptors.  The notable difference between these two genes is in the extra-cellular domain.  Whilst the tandem-neck-repeat region remains relatively constant in size in DC-SIGN, there is considerable polymorphism in L-SIGN.  Homooligomerization of the neck region of L-SIGN has been shown to be important for high-affinity ligand binding, and heterozygous expression of the polymorphic variants of L-SIGN in which neck lengths differ could thus affect ligand-binding affinity.

In contrast, hDC-SIGN but not mDC-SIGN expression efficiently and specifically augmented EBOV-GP mediated infectious entry, while all chimeras harboring the mDC-SIGN CRD did not enhance EBOV-GP-dependent infection ( Fig.  4 , left panel).  These results suggest that the mDC-SIGN CRD does not recognize EBOV-GP and that this defect cannot be rescued by linking the CRD to the hDC-SIGN neck.  Insertion of the mDC-SIGN cytoplasmic domain and transmembrane domain into hDC-SIGN was compatible with enhancement of infection, while the additional insertion of the mDC-SIGN neck abrogated augmentation of infection ( Fig.  4 , right panel).  However, the respective variant, CCCD, was not efficiently expressed on 293T cells (Fig.  3 , lower panel), and we therefore repeated the infection with a CHO cell line stably expressing this lectin to appreciable levels ( Fig.  5A) .  Again, CCCD was defective in the interaction with EBOV-GP bearing pseudotypes (data not shown), suggesting that the mDC-SIGN neck prevents the interaction with virionassociated EBOV-GP.  Here, we investigated if patient derived DC-SIGNR alleles with five and six repeat units augment infection by HIV-1 and by HIV-pseudotypes bearing the envelope glycoprotein of EBOV and the spike (S) protein of SARS-coronavirus (CoV).  We report that DC-SIGNR alleles with five, six or seven repeat units bind to viral glycoproteins, enhance viral infection and form tetramers with comparable efficiency, indicating that the absence of two repeat units does not appreciably compromise DC-SIGNR interaction with pathogens.

Carriers of the deletion would express less membrane-bound receptor and an attenuated pro-inflammatory response Because CCR5 is not a recognised receptor for SARS-Cov-2 the most likely explanation for the protective effect of Δ 32 in COVID-19 is an attenuated inflammatory response among the CCR5-deletion carriers.

They are located in two different chromosomes in lower aquatic vertebrates, and evolved to lie in one chromosome by chromosomal fusion in higher mammals (Fig.  4A) .  The syntenic relationship of IR-IFITM genes and the presence of more IR-IFITM genes in mammals than other vertebrates suggest that IR-IFITM gene sub-family experienced a rapid expansion via tandem duplication during evolution from lower vertebrates to mammals.  We further investigated changes in gene families in the noctilionid bat superfamily, including Pteronotus mesoamericanus and the phyllostomids Artibeus jamaicensis, Desmodus rotundus and Phyllostomus discolor.  Our analysis revealed an expansion of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) gene family (PTHR13999, p=2. 18e-05) in the phyllostomids ( Figure 4 ).  IFITM genes are potent antiviral factors as they can prevent infection before a virus passes the lipid bilayer of the cell 77, 78 .  These genes belong to a group of host restriction factors, that include members of the APOBEC3 family, protecting cells from viral invasion.  Of the five human IFITM proteins, three have antiviral activity (IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3) while the other two (IFITM5 and IFITM10) have no known role in immunity 79 .

This suggests that these cysteine residues play important structural and functional roles.  Two cysteine residues are present in the signal peptide and are not likely to participate in intramolecular disulfide bonds of the mature protein.  The Cl cysteine is in the F 2 subunit, and the remaining 9 cysteine residues are in the Fi subunit.  Eight of the 9 cysteine residues are clustered in a narrow region near the transmembrane domain.  The transmembrane domain of the S protein is found in the region C-terminal of the S2 domain (Fig.  1B) .  A short cytoplasmic tail or endodomain is located at the C-terminal end of S.

DHHC3 catalyse PD-L1 palmitoylation.  Inhibition of PD-L1 palmitoylation using 2-bromopalmitate or via DHHC3 silencing increases anti-tumour activity in cells and in mice.  These discoveries of PD-1 and PD-L1 palmitoylation and targeting for modulation of T cell immune responses in cancer provide exciting opportunities for combinatorial approaches along with immune checkpoint therapy.  In DCs, TLR2 is found to be palmitoylated on Cys609 at the cytoplasmic edge of the transmembrane domain (Chesarino et al. , 2014) .  Multiple DHHCs (DHHC 2, 3, 6, 7, 15) are responsible for the palmitoylation of TLR2.  Inhibition of TLR2 palmitoylation either by 2-BP or mutation of the palmitoylation site leads to the decreased surface expression of TLR2 in DCs, without affecting the overall protein level and stability of TLR2.  Blocking TLR2 palmitoylation also inhibits microbial ligands-induced activation of NF-κB and production of IL-6 and TNFα, which is, at least partially, due to the insufficient surface expression of TLR2.  Similar to TLR2, other TLRs (TLR5,6,10) have been shown to be palmitoylated in DCs (Chesarino et al. , 2014) .  Whether and how palmitoylation regulates their function remain to be addressed.  Phosphorylation also appears to regulate palmitoylation of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoform PDE10A2 (Charych et al. , 2010) .  The N terminus of PDE10A2 contains a palmitoylated cysteine residue (Cys11) that is essential for membrane anchoring and efficient dendritic transport in striatal neurons.  Palmitoylation was perturbed when phosphomimetic mutations were introduced into a downstream PKA phosphorylation site .  Does phosphorylation at Thr-16 actively promote depalmitoylation of Cys-11, or does it block palmitoylation of this cysteine? In fact, PKA activation markedly enhanced PDE10A2 phosphorylation but had no acute effect on membrane expression levels.  This observation suggests that phosphorylation does not promote depalmitoylation and membrane release of PDE10A2 but, instead, likely inhibits membrane binding by blocking palmitoylation.  This phosphoregulation of palmitoylation might be relevant to many palmitoylated peripheral proteins and could represent a mechanism to promote a shift toward the depalmitoylated state of a protein in the absence of active (thioesterase driven) depalmitoylation.  Negatively charged phosphate groups are likely to inhibit palmitoylation of neighboring cysteines by interfering with membrane interactions before palmitoylation (Fig", "time": 1.843330917000003}

Cells transfected by a plasmid DNA encoding mouse IFITM5 were grown in the presence of an established chemical reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) [29, 30] , or an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP) [31] .  The biochemical assays using these compounds revealed that the wild-type IFITM5 is S-palmitoylated.  To identify the Spalmitoylation site in IFITM5, we prepared cysteine-substituted mutants, IFITM5-C86A, -C52A/C53A, and -C52A/53A/86A (Cys-less).  The chemical reporter assay suggested that at least two out of three cysteines in IFITM5 are S-palmitoylated.  The interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was examined by immunoprecipitation assay, resulting in the loss of the interaction in the presence of 2BP.  The same result was obtained in the two mutants, C52A/C53A and Cys-less.  These results suggested that the S-palmitoylation on Cys52 and/or Cys53 in the TM1 domain of IFITM5 is necessary for the interaction with FKBP11.  On the other hand, Cys86 in the CP loop of IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated but not involved in the interaction.  Because this interaction is important for the immunologically relevant gene expression, it was indicated that the role of the S-palmitoylation is to promote the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 and to regulate the immune activity in the osteoblast cells.  The possible interaction mechanism and the effect of the S-palmitoylation on the bone nodule formation will be discussed.  Chikungunya virus inhibits DNA sensing by degrading cGAS demonstrated that nsP1 of CHIKV is palmitoylated and inhibition of this post-translational modification has myriad effects ranging from altering replication kinetics to pathogenesis in mice [16] [17] [18] [19] 66] .  Because of this association we hypothesized that nsP1s interaction with STING could result in increased levels of palmitoylated nsP1 and this could serve as a mechanism by which STING stabilize nsP1 expression.  The described STING-nsP1 interaction, also resulted in a significant inhibition of the IFNβ promotor activation by cGAS-STING overexpression (S2B Fig) .  These data provide the first description of CHIKV interaction with STING.  Furthermore, we mapped the interaction to a 23aa cytosolic loop of STING and demonstrates that this interaction could have a pro-viral role with respect to increasing the amount of nsP1 in infected cells in a STING dependent manner, while downregulating the IFNβ production pathway.  To mimick phosphorylation of GRK2 at Ser-29, we constructed a Ser29Asp mutant (S29D).  GRK2 interacted with calmodulin in the presence of 5 mM EGTA and the interaction increased at 1 mM Ca 2+ .  Calmodulin was able to interact with both GRK2(1-53) and GRK2(552-689), in agreement with predictions from the calmodulin target database (http://calcium. uhnres", "time": 2.745851124999998}

Of all the IFITMs, IFITM3 is the most potent anti-influenza effector in vitro (Huang et al. , 2011) .  Ifitm3 has a critical role in limiting influenzainduced morbidity and mortality in mice (Everitt et al. , 2012) .  As the phenotype of influenza-infected Ifitm3 2/2 mice is indistinguishable from that of mice deleted for the entire locus (comprising Ifitm1, -2, -3, -5 and -6), Ifitm3 apparently dominates influenza resistance in vivo (Bailey et al. , 2012) .  Moreover, the importance of IFITM3 was highlighted by reports showing that an IFITM3 allele (rs12252-C) is associated with enhanced disease severity caused by pandemic influenza virus H1N1/09 (Everitt et al. , 2012; Zhang et al. , 2013b) and highly pathogenic influenza virus H7N9 (Wang et al. , 2014) and is more frequent in Chinese than in Caucasian populations.

Here, we demonstrated that p53 up-regulated IFITM3 protein expression through enhancing its palmitoylation.  ZDHHC1 was transcriptionally up-regulated by p53 to promote IFITM3 palmitoylation and stability.  Further investigation confirmed the critical role of ZDHHC1-IFITM3 axis in mediating p53's anti-JEV effect.  Interestingly, for viral evasion, JEV reduced p53 expression to impair ZDHHC1 mediated IFITM3 palmitoylation.  Our data suggest the existence of a previously unrecognized p53-ZDHHC1-IFITM3 regulatory pathway in restricting JEV replication.  Given that p53 up-regulates IFITM3 palmitoylation (Fig 3) and ZDHHC1 expression (Fig 4) , we therefore determined whether ZDHHC1 up-regulates IFITM3 palmitoylation.  To this end, Flag-ZDHHC1 and HA-IFITM3 were cotransfected to examine the levels of palmitoylated IFITM3.  Exogenous expression of Flag-ZDHHC1 increased levels of palmitoylated IFITM3 compared with vector control (Fig 5A) .  The palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC1 contains a DHHC domain, which is critical for palmitoyltransferase activity, and mutation of this domain often results in lack of palmitoyltransferase activity [36] [37] [38] .  To determine if the palmitoyltransferase activity of ZDHHC1 was essential for IFITM3 palmitoylation, we therefore generated a palmitoyltransferase-dead mutant [36] (Flag-ZDHHC1-mutant) and examined its effect on IFITM3 palmitoylation.  In contrast to wild type Flag-ZDHHC1, Flag-ZDHHC1-mutant had no significant effect on palmitoylated IFITM3 protein levels compared with vector control (Fig 5A) .

In the absence of 2BP (Figure 5-A, -C, and -D) , the mineralization was started 15 days after the initiation of the cell differentiation (Day 0).  On the other hand, in the presence of 2BP ( Figure 5-B and -D) , the nodule was formed on Day 12.  The halftime for the maximum mineralization in the presence of 2BP was estimated to be 7 days earlier than that in the absence of 2BP (Figure 5-D) .

The stained nodules were diffused in the presence of 2BP (panel b), whereas in the absence of 2BP the nodules formed a large cluster (panels a and c).  Therefore, our observations in this study suggested that the S-palmitoylation affects the bone nodule formation in the osteoblast cells.  Therefore, we concluded that the IFITM5 expressed in the native osteoblast cells is S-palmitoylated.  In addition, the bands corresponding to the high and the low molecular-mass forms shown in western blot analysis were tentatively assigned to the S-palmitoylated and the depalmitoylated forms, respectively.  In total, 20 IFITM5 genes were identified in 20 vertebrates, covering species from teleosts to eutherians (Fig.  2B ).  No IFITM5 gene was identified in gorilla, marmoset, tree shrew, rabbit, dog, fugu, or medaka.

The average size of IFITM proteins including IFITM1-IFITM5 are 130 amino acids and share a topology defined by a conserved CD225 domain [24, 25] , consisting of two intramembrane (IM) regions and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL).  One or more IFITM proteins can be constitutively expressed in specific cells and tissues [25] , such as a wide range of human tissues expressing IFITM1-IFITM3, while IFITM5 is expressed only in osteoblasts [26] .  Potentially, this constitutive expression pattern of IFITM can provide the first line of defense against virus infection [26] .  Increasingly, reports showed that IFITM offers protection against numerous viruses, including Influenza A, Rift Valley fever virus, SARS coronavirus, filoviruses, Dengue and HIV, through several routes, including inhibiting formation of a fusion pore between the virus and endosomal membranes [26] [27] [28] [29] .  In mouse models, IFITM3 has been shown to have the most antiviral activity of the IFITM class for the viruses investigated and restricted in influenza A virus infection [30] .

The putative IFITM5 gene is located next to an uncharacterized gene (ENSGALG00000006478), with which it shares 30% amino acid identity.  Immediately adjacent to this are three sequence gaps whose estimated sizes are 1 kb, 1 kb, and 400 bp in the ENSEMBL chicken genome build.  Importantly, the putative IFITM genes in chicken are flanked by the telomeric ␤-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 4 (B4GALNT4) gene and the centromeric acid trehalase-like 1 (ATHL1) gene.  The B4GALNT4 and ATHL1 genes flank the antiviral IFITM 1, 2, -3, and -5 gene block in mammalian genomes.  Sequence similarity searches of the most recent build of the chicken genome (v4. 0, NCBI) using TBLASTN analysis and the putative IFITM5 amino acid sequence, revealed several transcripts with high amino acid identity to IFITM5.

The C-terminal region is tightly compressed into a slightly curved disk, which renders the protein resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis.  The convex face of the protein contains 12 calcium-binding sites [3] which, when occupied, lead to a conformational change that exposes the N-terminal domain III.

The role of ANXA1 has been investigated in a variety of different diseases, including cardiology, immunology, neurology, endocrinology, and oncology [5] [6] [7] .  One of ANXA1's most important properties is its ability to alter the innate and adaptive immune system [5, 8] .  In addition to the well-documented role in neutrophil and monocyte function in the innate immune system, it has been shown to modulate the signaling strength of the T cell receptor and consequently the T cell activation and differentiation [9, 10] .

Species C is primarily responsible for the respiratory tract infections in children, whereas species B and E are more likely to infect healthy adults [9] .  However, incidences of adenovirus-associated illnesses are higher among children than among adults.  As such, in China, the impact of HAdVs on respiratory infection is well characterized in children [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] but not in adults.  In the United States, while most common coronavirus infections are in adults and peak in early winter, the age distribution by species differs [8] .  For example, infections with 229E are less common in children than those of the 3 other species [8] .  Interestingly, in a pediatric cohort from Norway, 33% of asymptomatic control children were infected with NL63 or HKU1 versus 22% in the symptomatic hospitalized cohort [9] .  A small Spanish cohort showed that adults with common coronavirus were mainly male smokers, presented mainly with nonspecific influenza-like illness symptoms or pneumonia, and generally had favorable outcomes despite a 52% hospitalization rate [10] .  Specific coronavirus species have been implicated in outbreaks of severe infection in a neonatal intensive care unit (ICU; 229E) and in a long-term care facility (NL63) [1] .  The study did not quantify the disease burden of PIV-3 or HMPV, which were the fifth and sixth greatest causes of disease in adults over 65 years of age, ahead of coronaviruses.  This study predated the discovery of HMPV, two of the four coronaviruses and rhinovirus species C.

In summary, the findings of this study provide vital information regarding the frequency of RSV infection among patients of different age with ARTI in Kuwait.  Sequence analysis of the circulating strains demonstrated the predominance of the RSV-A group over the RSV-B group in these patients.  Additionally, the circulating RSV-A strains were untyped strains, indicating heterogenicity among group A RSV strains.  On the other hand, most of the strains of the RSV-B group belonged to the BA10 genotype, showing the predominance of this genotype among patients with ARTI in Kuwait.  We are firmly recommending whole-genome sequencing of the untyped Kuwaiti strains for full strain characterisation, which will be accomplished in the next project.  Further surveillance and sequencing of RSV strains are required to determine if these untyped Kuwaiti strains are still circulating in this region and if the dominance of certain RSV genotypes over others is sustained over time or fluctuates from year to year.

In addition, these cells possess cytotoxic capacities and can directly clear the infected cells.  50, 51 Indirectly, the importance of HBV-reactive CD4 + T cells is confirmed by high frequencies of these cells in resolving acute hepatitis and their lack of chronic HBV infection.  27 The versatile role of CD4 + Th cells was also shown in varicella and BK virus settings.  52 At this time point, we can only speculate on the capacity of the detected polyfunctional T cells to protect against HBV infection in hemodialysis patients.  Further studies are required to elucidate the exact role of the identified HBs-reactive T cells in preventing or combating HBV infection in absent of humoral immunity.  Since T cells are capable to exert cytolytic and cytokine-mediated non-cytolytic effector functions, an important biological question is whether both effector functions are required to mediate viral clearance.  In HBV infection, two important studies by using HBV transgenic mice [41] and HBV-infected chimpanzees [42] clearly show that hepatocyte destruction is not required for antiviral efficacy.  It is presently unclear whether there are additional cellular factors besides NTCP required for viral infection and determining the tissue and species tropism of HBV.  These include factors essentially involved in the viral lifecycle during attachment, internalization, endocytosis, membrane fusion, uncoating, nuclear translocation and cccDNA formation and those affecting post-entry restriction.  Overexpression of hNTCP in mouse hepatocyte cell lines, such as Hepa1-6 and MMHD3 cells, did not confer susceptibility to HBV infection, in contrast to the HBV infection observed after NTCP introduction into HepG2 cells [44] .  hNTCP conferred efficient HBV infection in HepG2 cells, but only a low efficiency of infection was observed in Huh-7 and undifferentiated HepaRG cells and no detectable infection to mouse and rat hepatoma cells, including Hep56. 1D, Hepa1-6 and TC5123 cells [38] .  We also showed that different HepG2 clone isolates that similarly expressed high levels of ectopic NTCP, but were likely to have different cellular genetic backgrounds, had diverse efficiencies of HBV infection [43] .  These observations favor the existence of additional host factors determining susceptibility to HBV infection.  It has been reported that the complementation of both hCD81 and hOCLN are required for rendering high HCV susceptibility in mice [49] .  Furthermore, in the case of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), multiple factors are suggested to be essential for efficient viral infection.  Carboxypeptidase D was confirmed to bind the DHBV envelope and function in viral attachment and entry [50] .  However, overexpression of this protein alone in Huh-7 cells did not support DHBV infection [51] .

Among others, the heparan sulfates in the membrane proteins mediate the broad, but less specific, virus-cell interaction.  However, the high affinity membrane partners for HBV remain elusive (the carboxypeptidase D found for duck hepatitis B virus may be the only serious contender [2] ).  Our analysis revealed that two biological pathways, ECM-receptor interaction and MAPK signaling, were significantly enriched pathways associated with the susceptibility to human A(H7N9) infection.  The extracellular matrix consists of a complex mixture of functional macromolecules and provides structural and functional support to the surrounding cells, including proteoglycans, non-proteoglycan polysaccharide, collagens, fibronectin and laminin etc.  The ECM interacts with transmembrane receptors to mediate cellular activities such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis.

Importantly, the two topologies provide separate functions to the L protein.  Indeed, the e-preS domain is exposed on the surface of the virion and participates in virus receptor binding (Urban and Gripon, 2002) , whereas the i-preS domain is important for interaction with the nucleocapsid (Bruss, 2004) .  The envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus play a major role in virus budding.  Patients infected by this virus release subviral particles that contain predominantly the S protein with variable amounts of M and only trace quantities of L subunits (Ganem and Schneider, 2001) .  In addition, expression of S protein alone also leads to the production of subviral particles, indicating that the viral information necessary for this assembly process resides in the S domain.  These subviral particles are assembled in a pre-Golgi compartment.  The envelopment of the hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid depends on viral envelope proteins.  The S and L proteins, but not the M protein, are required for this process (Bruss, 2004) .  The nucleocapsid is incorporated into particles by interaction of the i-preS domain of the L protein.  HBV envelope protein, namely the surface antigens, plays an essential role in the infection process.  Both genetic and functional examination identified one domain in the Nterminus of HBV preS1 (amino acids 1-47) necessary for infection.  This domain has been shown to function as a direct mediator for HBV by binding presumably cellular corresponding receptor(s) [3] .  More importantly, the myristoylated peptide is shown to effectively block HBV infection in primary human hepatocytes and in the human hepatocytechimera mouse at a nanomolar concentration [4] .  In fact, a clinical trial testing the efficacy of this peptide in preventing HBV infection has been ongoing [5] .  Clearly, this preS1 peptide can be a useful probe to pull out the interacting cellular factors, including specific viral receptors.  In coronavirus, the S-proteins are anchored to the lipid envelope like a type I receptor and contains 3 domains, i. e.  a large N-terminal surface domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal domain located inside the envelope (Cavanagh, 1995) .

We found that our 9A8 mAb recognizes amino acids 317-326 of NTCP on intact cells without membrane permeabilization, implying that this epitope is possibly exposed to the extracellular space.  More precise structural biological studies should be carried out to elucidate the topology of the NTCP protein.  CsA Blocked HBV Infection Through Targeting NTCP.  Recently, NTCP was reported as a candidate entry receptor for HBV.  22 A transporter activity assay showed that CsA inhibited the activity of NTCP both in 293 (Fig.  5A) and HepG2 cells (Fig.  5B ) engineered to stably overexpress NTCP, as previously reported.  35 CsA was also suggested to bind to NTCP on the membrane in a ligand binding assay using HepG2-NTCP cells (Fig.  S2) .  In this study, we generated iNTCP cells, which have high NTCP expression and high susceptibility to HBV infection, and also developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes cell-surface NTCP.  Using these tools, we identified glabridin as a compound that inhibits HBV infection by downregulating levels of its entry receptor, NTCP.  Although primary hepatocytes express NTCP at low levels for the uptake of bile acids, endogenous NTCP in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines is not sufficient to achieve successful infection with HBV in vitro.  To overcome these issues, we created the iNTCP cell line, featuring inducible NTCP expression, using the third-generation tetracyclineinducible gene expression system in HepG2 cells.

So far it was suggested that molecular determinants of NTCP critical for HBV entry overlap with those required for bile acid transport.  To further confirm whether the function for bile acid transport and the capacity to support HBV entry can be distinguishable, we searched for compounds that bind NTCP and inhibit its function as a bile acid transporter but cannot inhibit HBV infection.

NTCP substrates, such as taurocholate, tauroursodeoxycholate and bromosulfophthalein, also inhibited HBV infection [38, 42, 68 ].  An anticholesteremic drug, ezetimibe, has been shown to block HBV entry [82] , and this drug was reported to inhibit the NTCP transporter [83] .  These results indicate that compounds modulating NTCP function could substantially inhibit HBV infection.  HepG2 cells engineered to overexpress NTCP are also useful for high-throughput screening to identify compounds targeting NTCP and inhibiting HBV infection.  One example identified in such chemical screening is the oxysterols, which are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol or by-products of cholesterol biosynthesis [43] .  CsA Blocked HBV Infection Through Targeting NTCP.  Recently, NTCP was reported as a candidate entry receptor for HBV.  22 A transporter activity assay showed that CsA inhibited the activity of NTCP both in 293 (Fig.  5A) and HepG2 cells (Fig.  5B ) engineered to stably overexpress NTCP, as previously reported.  35 CsA was also suggested to bind to NTCP on the membrane in a ligand binding assay using HepG2-NTCP cells (Fig.  S2) .  In this study, we generated iNTCP cells, which have high NTCP expression and high susceptibility to HBV infection, and also developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes cell-surface NTCP.  Using these tools, we identified glabridin as a compound that inhibits HBV infection by downregulating levels of its entry receptor, NTCP.  Although primary hepatocytes express NTCP at low levels for the uptake of bile acids, endogenous NTCP in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines is not sufficient to achieve successful infection with HBV in vitro.  To overcome these issues, we created the iNTCP cell line, featuring inducible NTCP expression, using the third-generation tetracyclineinducible gene expression system in HepG2 cells.  Upon transient treatment with tetracycline derivatives, this cell line exhibits high expression of cell-surface NTCP and becomes highly susceptible to HBV infection without any observable cell cycle arrest.  This unique feature of our newly developed cell line makes it a useful tool for further biological analysis of NTCP in hepatic cells.  Our data suggest that certain compounds can inhibit HBV entry without significantly affecting the transporter function of NTCP", "time": 2.0230684170000046}

Establishment of an accurate and easy method for detection of these viruses is essential for the prevention and treatment of associated infectious diseases.  Currently, ELISA and IFA are the methods which are clinically-available for the detection of encephalitis viral antigens, but they could only detect one pathogen in one assay [2, 3] .  Using temporal lobe tissue from a case with severe gliosis (Fig.  4A) , we did not detect MHC antigen expression, either class I or II, in situ.  Although astrocyte cultures were not available in this case, oligodendrocytes derived from this case did express class I MHC antigens in vitro.  As a control for the in situ studies, we analyzed frontal lobe tissue from a case of chronic encephalitis and were able to detect MHC class I and II immunostaining.  This staining was predominantly associated with non-GFAP + cells, likely macrophages (Fig.  4B ).  Autoimmune encephalitis and paraneoplastic encephalitis are caused by the presence of an antibody targeting CNS antigens that may be common to antigens expressed by a tumor tissue.  Clinical presentations are non-specific and may mimic all symptoms of infectious encephalitis, although some clinical presentations, such as anti-NMDA-R antibody encephalitis, have specific presentations.  Knowledge on this topic is rapidly growing and reference centers need to work together in that respect.

By detecting viral antigens directly in patient specimens, either by fluorescent antibody methods or enzyme immunoassay-based techniques, it was possible to obtain a result within a clinically useful time period.  Antigen-detection tests remain an important tool in viral diagnostics; however, this method also has shortcomings, with some methods having poor sensitivity for some viral targets, particularly in adult populations.  In addition, owing to the lack of conserved antigens there are several respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, for which antigen-detection assays do not exist.  6. 3.  Biological Sample Preparation Method for Different Target Biomarkers.  Herein, we briefly introduce the biological sample preparation methods for detecting different biomarkers.  The preparation methods for detecting nucleic acid, antigens, and antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 are described as follows: Particle agglutination methodologies have been employed for detecting group B streptococcal antigens in CSF or urine.  Testing of urine samples has been discouraged because the urine sample may be positive as the result of skin or genitourinary contamination, or possibly from intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of antigen.  (31) Many laboratories have discontinued antigen testing of CSF because it generally offers no better sensitivity than a properly performed Gram stain.  No rapid tests have proved sensitive enough to determine maternal colonization directly from vaginal swabs.  However, sensitive PCR test is now coming into use.  (32) 3. 4. 1. 5.

In the future, with increasing numbers of suitable antibodies, especially specific antibodies against Flavivirus, this ELISAarray might be able to test more pathogens and be of greater potential use.  To make the assay more amenable to multiple virus detection, the assay protocol was optimized.  In addition to the dotting buffer, the capture antibody concentration and the different virus inactivation methods (heating and β-propiolactone) were also compared and evaluated.  Heat inactivation was performed by heating the viral cultures at 56°C for 1 h, and β-propiolactone inactivation was performed by adding β-propiolactone into the retains better antigenicity than the heat-inactivation method.  Thus, β-propiolactone treatment was chosen as the virus-inactivation method.  A conventional ELISA is a standard method in many diagnostic laboratories.  We compared the ELISA-array with a conventional ELISA and confirmed that the advantage of the ELISA-array was evident with comparable specificity and higher sensitivity than ELISA.  The time required for the ELISA-array is significantly less than for conventional ELISA (4 h vs.  a minimum of 6 h, respectively).  Furthermore, less IgG is required for printing than for coating ELISA plates.  Coating of a single well in microtiter plate requires 100 μl of a 1 μg/ml antibody solution, which is equivalent to 100 ng of IgG.  For the ELISA-array, only 30 nl of a 50 μg/ml antibody solution is required for each spot, which is equivalent to 1. 5 ng of IgG.  With the characteristics of ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, the ELISA-array assay would be widely accepted for clinical use.   The unique glycan structures from pathogens and aberrantly glycosylated antigens of cancer cells have guided the development of carbohydrate-based vaccines.

The cysteine proteases from Streptococcus sp.  (streptopain) [1] , Staphylococcus sp.

They are specific for CA clan of cysteine protease and didn't show any significant inhibition against other clans of cysteine proteases.  Cystatins are virtually the most widely represented class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors, ubiquitously distributed in plants and animals, and devoted to regulating degradation of both intracellular and extracellular proteins.  Cystatins function as competitive inhibitors which coordinate the biological activity of C1 class (papain-like) cysteine proteases that are involved in proteolytic processes [28] .  Cystatins bind to the active site of cysteine proteases as pseudo-substrates thus making target cysteine proteases unable of cleaving peptide bonds.

Innovative bioactive molecule delivery that can be used for central nervous system diseases with targeted imaging biomaterials.  For the pharmaceutical industry, these new technologies that deliver bioactive molecules are a strategic tool for their development.  Technology can offer new solutions for the already existing bioactive molecules, increasing their effectiveness, improving their safety, and offering better patient compliance.  Moreover, new drugs being developed under computational chemistry, using the knowledge gained from the human genome decoding program, need administration and delivery to the damaged tissues systems in order to be effective.  Nanotechnology offers the possibility of administering bioactive molecules that are practically insoluble to water or unstable to biological environment.  Designing and developing delivery nanosystems that target damaged tissues are an emerging direction in therapy.  Even though nanotechnology offers the possibility of developing effective delivery systems for all kinds of bioactive molecules, the major directions are the developments in drug administration in diseases of the respiratory, the central nervous, and the cardiovascular system.  The efficient delivery of siRNAs is a vital step in RNAi-based gene silencing.  The effectiveness of the RNAi as a therapeutic agent greatly depends on the efficient delivery of siRNA to the correct intracellular location, to interact with the RNAi machinery within the target cell, within the target tissue responsible for the pathology.  Each of these levels of targeting poses a significant barrier.  Several strategies have been developed to overcome these barriers, such as chemical modifications of siRNA, viral nucleic acid delivery systems, and nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems.  The method widely used to facilitate the efficient delivery of siRNA is high-pressure intravenous (i. v. ) injection [118, 119] .  In this method, a large volume of siRNA solution is injected into the circulation in a relatively short time; this puts the recipient at risk for acute heart failure.  Also, hydrodynamic injection delivers siRNA throughout the body, thus inducing undesirable suppression of gene expression in some organs [119] .  Later on, mechanical methods like electroporation and sonoparation were developed to deliver siRNA to the target tissue [120, 121] .  Electroporation is a convenient and efficient method in which electrical shocks are applied to the membrane, producing pores, and allowing the negatively charged external molecules to enter into the cytosol by electrophoresis [120] ", "time": 1.7965230000000076}

Administration by inhalation is a popular and non-invasive method of delivering agents into the lungs.  There are several inhalation devices available for the delivery of drugs into the lungs.  Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are the most common modes of inhaled delivery.  MDIs are the most commonly used inhalers for several lung diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a spacer is an external device that is attached to an MDI to allow for better drug delivery by enhanced actuation and inhalation coordination.  For most MDIs, the propellant is one or more gases called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  Although CFCs in drugs are safe for patients to inhale, they are harmful to the environment.  Therefore, further development of inhalable siRNAs may not be the best way forward.  DPIs are devices that deliver medication to the lungs in the form of dry powder.  The use of DPIs has already shown promise for the in vivo delivery of therapeutic macromolecules such as insulin [39] and low-molecular-weight heparin [40] ; thus, it could be a better device for delivering siRNAs to the lungs.  The advantages of DPIs are improved stability and sterility of biomolecules over liquid aerosols and propellant-free formation.  We do not recommend the use of a nebulizer during the pandemic as there is an increased risk of aerosol spread of virus particles 13 .  Instead, patients should use metered dose inhalers with spacing devices, soft mist inhalers or dry powder inhalers to administer all COPD medications at home, and inside healthcare facilities and nursing homes.  Patients who are already using nebulizers at home should continue to do so until they can be switched to alternative delivery methods.

Briefly, BHK-21 cells were infected with 100 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of different adenoviruses in presence of polybrene (6 g/ml) for 6 h.  After 24 h treatment, transduction efficiency was analyzed by X-gal staining.  Li et al.  first tested an equimolar mixture of siSC2 and siSC5 (referred to as siSC2-5), as well as two unrelated control siRNAs siCONc-d, in mice.  The siRNAs were delivered intratracheally in 5% aqueous glucose or in INFASURF (Forest Laboratories, Inc. , New York, NY).  (INFASURF is a prescription pharmaceutical that is instilled into the lungs of newborn infants with, or at risk for, respiratory failure.  It is a sterile, organic solvent extract of calf lung lavage, containing surfactant proteins B and C (SP-B and C), with a protein-B level closest to that of natural surfactant. ) The siRNAs were co-delivered with pCI-scLuc plasmid.  The pCI-scLuc plasmid contained corresponding siSC2 and siSC5-targeted DNA sequence between its cytomegalovirus promoter-driven transcriptional initiation site and luciferase encoding sequence.  This setup allowed easy monitoring of delivery efficiency from Luc assay.  Interestingly, co-delivery in 5% glucose resulted in a higher level of reporter gene expression and stronger RNAi effect than that delivered in the INFASURF solution.  Hence the former (i. e. , naked siRNA) was employed in 5% glucose for experiments in Rhesus macaque.  With siRNAs instilled intranasally, observations of SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence, and lung histopathology and immunohistochemistry consistently showed siRNA-mediated anti-SARS efficacy by either prophylactic or therapeutic regimens.  The siRNAs used provided relief from SCV infection-induced fever, diminished SCV viral levels, and reduced acute diffuse alveoli damage.

Considering that epitheliums in different sections of the respiratory tract have varying susceptibility to inhaled agents, the dosimetry in the upper airway [ Fig.  7(b) ] was further separated into four regions, nose, mouth, pharynx, and larynx, as shown in Fig.  8 (a) (before correction) and Fig.  8(b) (after correction) .  It is clear that wearing a mask not only changes the overall DF in the upper airway but also the DF distribution among the four regions.  Figure 8 (c) shows the comparison of the nose deposition with (after correction) and without a mask.  In contrast to the high sensitivity of the nasal DF to particle size without a mask, the nasal DF was found to be relatively independent of the particle size when wearing a mask.  On the other hand, the laryngeal DF shows high sensitivities, regardless of the presence of a mask.  These particle-size-dependent differences highlight the need for future testing of mask filtration efficiency of monodisperse aerosols.  Future estimation of infectious respiratory disease transmission and presentation should also consider these size-related discrepancies for more reliable predictions.  The surface deposition in the upper airway is shown in Fig.  8 (e) for four particle sizes (1 μm, 5 μm, 10 μm, and 20 μm) with and without a mask.

Note the highly different deposition patterns among the four different sized aerosols with a mask shown in the upper panel of Fig.  8(e) .  Even though the cumulative deposition in the nose may be insensitive to particle size, the local deposition can still be highly sensitive, corroborating the need to study monodisperse aerosols.

[61] reported that naked siRNA failed to mediate any gene silencing in vitro in mouse fibroblast cell lines whereas conjugation of siRNA to cell penetrating peptides (TAT or penetratin), or lipid carrier (cholesterol) resulted in 20-40% gene silencing effect at mRNA level.  Surprisingly when they proceeded to in vivo study, they found that naked siRNA managed to produce a 30-45% gene knockdown at mRNA level.  Neither TAT nor penetratin improved the transfection efficiency as compared of naked siRNA.  The use of cell penetrating peptides was even found to trigger inflammatory response in lung tissues.  In a more recent study, Gutbier et al.  [60] demonstrated that the epithelial E-cadherin was reduced moderately by 21% in mouse lung tissues following intratracheal delivery of naked target-specific siRNA, but no significant reduction of endothelial VEcadherin or lamin B1 was observed.  The use of lipid-based delivery vector (DPhyPE/DSPE-PEG) was found to evoke inflammatory response in the lungs.  Preferential gene expression in lungs upon i. v.  delivery when DNA is complexed with unmodified cationic liposomes or polycations is rather fortuitous in the context of lung-affecting diseases and may be exploited for siRNA delivery in the treatment of lung diseases.  It is noteworthy that intranasal delivery of naked siRNA has been shown to result in therapeutic gene silencing, and is as efficient as that with non-viral vectors.  A plausible reason for the success of this method is that degradation of siRNA by nucleases is not significant in the airway [29] unlike other routes such as i. v.  wherein no significant gene silencing has been observed with naked siRNA [32, 34, 47] .  Systemic delivery of naked siRNA has generally failed to produce significant biological effects (gene silencing).

In addition, 0. 1-0. 4 billion surgical masks will be required for source control.  Estimates were sensitive to respirator use rates, especially in the outpatient setting, followed by police and fire (other settings in which demand was proportional to the size of the workforce).  Projected demand was especially sensitive to assumptions regarding use in different sectors.  For instance, assuming constant respirator use throughout the pandemic resulted in an estimated demand for respirators of up to 7. 3 billion.  We present a model that provides estimates of the potential demand for respirators and surgical masks during a pandemic for a variety of severity and attack rate scenarios.  These estimates will aid public health officials to plan how many respirators and surgical masks to stockpile and provide the basis for plans to quickly dispense them.  Another limitation of our calculations is that they were based on a hypothetical, unmitigated influenza pandemic and limitless care capacity by healthcare providers.

The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, with around 20 % of all cases to date involving healthcare workers (HCWs).  Global public health is under siege as a result of a coronavirus infectious pandemic disease that may have originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 (1, 2) , thus the acronym (COVID- 19) .

Diagnosis of IAE was identified according to documented diagnosis of influenza virus infection and encephalopathy during the same hospitalization.  Diagnosis of encephalopathy was determined according to diagnostic codes including virus-associated encephalopathy (ICD-10 code: G948), acute encephalopathy (G934), and delirium due to other medical condition (F058).  When a patient was admitted twice or more to the same hospital with a diagnosis of IAE during the study period, only the first admission with a diagnosis of IAE was included.  Influenza viruses and coronaviruses were the next most commonly identified viruses.  Fourteen of the 16 influenza virus infections were caused by influenza A viruses.  Influenza virus infection was more common in Study 1 where none of the influenza virus-infected subjects were documented to have received influenza vaccine in the prior year.  Twelve of the 16 coronavirus infections identified were caused by OC43-like strains.  Only one of the four infections with 229E-like strains occurred in hospitalized subjects, and all four of these infections were identified by RT-PCR.  The most common influenza pathogen is influenza A virus, which can infect humans, pigs, cattle, birds, as well as other animals (2, 4) .  ICV was first identified in humans in 1947.  This group of influenza viruses was initially thought to exclusively infect humans until isolates were identified in pigs in China (5, 6) and Japan (7) .  Antigenic and genetic analyses suggest that ICV might transmit between humans and pigs in nature (8) ; however, interspecies transmission has not been confirmed experimentally.  At least one virus was identified in 63 patients (Table 3) .  Influenza virus was the most common and was isolated in 28 patients (30. 8%), of whom 21 (75%) had Influenza A and 7 (25%) had Influenza B (Table 3) .

Variables of interest include the attack rate % (number of ill/total number), the attack rate difference (attack rate in exposed 2 attack rate in unexposed), and the attack rate ratio (attack rate in exposed/attack rate in unexposed).  Burgers have the highest attack rate %, attack rate difference and attack rate ratio, making them the most likely source of the diarrheal illness.   The major difference between the 25% attack rate and the 15% attack rate is the magnitude of the inoperability levels.  While the 15% attack rate peaked around 14% inoperability, the 25% attack rate peaks around 24% inoperability for the highest sector.  This means that, for an increase of 10% attack rate, we see an increase of 9% in the peak inoperability.  An epidemic curve was drawn based on the daily number of cases (Y-axis) and the onset date (X-axis).  The daily attack rate was defined as the number of COVID-19 cases per day per 10 6 people (/10 6 ).  To carry out spatiotemporal analysis, the district location of each case at the time of onset was used to draw a colour map.  A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the average daily new cases and attack rates of COVID-19 between in and outside Wuhan in different periods.  The global spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 attack rates was explored by Moran's I test.  Local Indicators of Spatial Association were generated to determine the location of spatial clusters of districts with similar COVID-19 attack rates.  We also calculated the doubling times of COVID-19 onset cases, 15 as follows: As shown in The attack rate in school students in the 10 townships was 1. 7%, but the attack rate in Township A was 5. 9%, and Township B was 2. 5%.

The R0 of COVID-19 on DP has been estimated previously in [15] ; they identified the R0 as 14. 8 initially and then declining to a stable 1. 78 after the quarantine and removal interventions.  They also suggest that the R0 of COVID-19 and contact rate are dependent on population density.  That research does not take account of asymptomatic cases.  Other researchers using data on the DP up to February 16 have estimated the median R0 as 2. 28 [16] .  They found R0 remained high despite quarantine measures, while concluding that estimating R0 was challenging due to the difficulty in identifying the exact number of infected cases.

Medical resource loss model studies in nonepidemic scenarios have determined required capacity based on the application of steady-state formulas [4] or linear simulation searches [23, 32] .  However, in our context, the rapidly changing rate of COVID-19 cases makes applying these approaches less accurate and inefficient.  In order to address the unique challenges of capacity optimization in a pandemic, we developed an approach that combines and modifies several existing techniques.  The core of our approach is an iterative search procedure to find the minimum number of ventilators required to keep the estimated loss probability from the simulation under 5%.  Our search procedure uses a stochastic root-finding method based on response surface methodology (RSM), which we describe in Subsection 3. 2. 2 and Appendix A.  Furthermore, to increase the efficiency of the search, we used an initial proximate required capacity from a pointwise stationary approximation (PSA) described in Subsection 3. 2. 1.  As a result, the availability of ventilators and ECMO machines may become a decisive factor in outcomes for many patients with severe disease.  At the time of writing, there was worldwide concern that there will be a shortfall of intensive care beds and of mechanical ventilators to support the most severe cases of COVID-19.  Estimates of the number of ventilators in the US in March 2020 ranged from 60,000 to 160,000 [28] , although the distribution of ventilators is unlikely to directly coincide with COVID-19 hotspots.

We urge three complementary avenues of action to reduce the imbalance between supply and demand for ventilators.  First, vigilant social distancing has potential to flatten the curve, 1 which will both delay and suppress the outbreak peak.  In addition to reducing the peak demand for ventilators, the delay would provide a window of opportunity to ramp up ventilator production.  Second, it is plausible that the USA will experience several asynchronous local peaks rather than one apex", "time": 1.7671602910000104}

Exhaled breath condensate-a noninvasive but complicated method.  It reflects the composition of the fluid lining the airway and successfully measures hydrogen peroxide, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, isoprostanes, nitric oxide-derived products, and hydrogen ions [55] .  However, the measurement of mediators within exhaled breath condensate is not very reproducible, and the technique warrants improvement [56] .  Other ways of indirectly assessing markers of inflammation in the lower airways have been considered, including exhaled gases and breath condensate, but they too have their limitations.  Exhaled NO (eNO) is reduced in CF (4); therefore, consideration could be given to measuring eNO in exhaled breath in a study of an anti-inflammatory drug that might impact the pathway leading to the upregulation of NO.  While investigators have measured some inflammatory mediators in exhaled breath condensate, the usefulness of these measures as outcomes remains to be defined as well.  Exhaled breath condensate is a promising source of biomarkers of lung disease in humans.  Exhaled breath condensate hydrogen peroxide concentration and pH were higher in horses with mild EA, vs.  controls (69) .  Additionally, both hydrogen peroxide and pH had a positive association with BAL neutrophil percentage, while leukotriene B-4 demonstrated a positive association with BAL eosinophil percentage.  Another study characterized the metabolomic profile of tracheal wash and exhaled breath condensate in healthy horses and those with severe EA (172) .  Higher concentrations of histamine and oxidant agents, such as glutamate, valine, leucine, and isoleucine, as well as lower levels of ascorbate, methylamine, dimethylamine and O-phosphocholine, were found in the group of severe EA, compared to healthy controls.  Breath analysis is an exciting new area with enormous diagnostic potential.  [93] [94] [95] Alveolar breath contains many biomarkers derived from the blood by passive diffusion across the alveolar membrane, 93 and also contains direct markers of lung injury.  [96] [97] [98] Breath testing is noninvasive, easily repeatable, and requires minimal specimen workup.

Yoga originated in ancient India and includes physical, mental, and spiritual practices with an explicit emphasis on different breathing patterns.  Yogic breathing in a controlled manner known as Pranayama is one of the eight limbs of traditional yoga.  According to \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika, \" these Pranayamas have various benefits on the mind and body as a whole (Muktibodhananda, 2012) .  'Severity' of symptoms relates to duration of fever, cough and shortness of breath.  Shortness of breath had its own severity scale and was crucial for staging level of complicated COVID-19, severity of pneumonia and sepsis.  29 30 Mild shortness of breath was defined as shortness of breath during activities that did not stop one completing the activity.  Moderate shortness of breath was defined differently depending on age.  Severe shortness of breath was defined as shortness of breath at rest.  To evaluate whether changes in breath metabolites characterize the exhaled breath of pediatric patients with SARS-CoV2 infection, we analyzed breath metabolite profiles from children with and without SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a major pediatric academic medical center.  Through targeted GCxGC-mass spectrometric analysis of 84 breath volatiles, we established the reproducible changes in pediatric breath biomarkers in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Before reviewing the graphics associated with mechanical ventilation, it is important to understand the concepts of how ventilators can deliver breaths.  A mechanical breath is classified based on three main variables-how the breath starts, how the breath is delivered by the machine, and how the breath is stopped [1] .  A breath can be started by either the patient (referred to as a supported or assisted breath) or by the machine (referred to as a controlled breath).  This variable is also referred to as the trigger.  After the breath is started, the gas is delivered to the patient in a set pattern that is sustained throughout the course of inspiration.  This is also referred to as the target variable.  The two main target variables are either a specific inspiratory flow rate or a pressure goal.  The delivery of the breath is stopped when a certain amount of time has elapsed, a goal amount of volume has been inspired, or the ventilator senses a decrease in the flow taken in by the patient", "time": 1.4716449999999952}
