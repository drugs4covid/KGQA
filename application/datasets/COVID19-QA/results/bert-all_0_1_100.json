In a pandemic like COVID-19, SARS etc. , detecting the infected individuals plays a crucial role in controlling the infection spread.  Detection of infected people has two major factors− governmental initiatives, and the efficiency as well as supply of the test kits.  Moreover, awareness and cooperation of the community also plays a significant role; though, often aware and cooperative infected people are detected in a population, but it is always challenging to detect the infected individuals with denial and resistance, which increases the risk of an outbreak.  These three factors are combined in the probability term p q .  We note that this testing efficiency parameter plays a major role in the spreading dynamics.  As shown in Fig.  6(a) , as p q increases both i max and τ decreases which helps to limit the infection.  Marital status plays a significant role in health behavior (Hilz and Wagner, 2018) .  The lack of a spouse increases the likelihood of health risk behaviors (Umberson, 1992; Norcross et al. , 1996; Schone and Weinich, 1998; Kim et al. , 2018) .  The immune system plays an important role in inflammation that occurs in adipose tissue due to obesity, which increases vulnerability to infections.  Inflammation in adipose tissue generates metabolic alterations that can cause comorbidities such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, thus increasing the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 2 .  Regarding respiratory tract, vitamin A plays a central role during lung development and alveolar function in the prenatal period, although in the postnatal stage, it is essential for lung growth, alveolarization, and plays a main role in resistance and elasticity, and repair and remodeling of lung.  Consequently, vitamin A deficiency can be associated with a low FVC, an indicator of airway obstruction and a strong predictor of mortality in asymptomatic adults without chronic respiratory conditions.  It also can cause squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium, with a decrease in mucus production, which increases the risk for invasive pathogens and severity of lower RTIs [278] ", "time": 20.377400166999998}

However, such variations do not seem to have a significant effect on disease progression (27) .  Furthermore, subjects with two or less copies of CCL3L1 have significantly higher risk of acquiring HIV infection.  A recent study carried out in the Japanese population (27) has shown that the average copy number of CCL3L1 in the HIV-1-infected subjects is significantly lower than that in healthy controls (3. 35 AE 0. 24 vs 5. 00 AE 0. 22, P < 0. 001).  On the contrary, studies in the North Indian population showed that the copy number variation in CCL3L1 has no effect on acquisition (28) .  It is worth mentioning that chimpanzees that are naturally resistant to HIV-1 possess very high ($9-10) CCL3L1 copy numbers (25, 29) .  Macro_c2-CCL3L1, the three subtypes of monocytes and the neutrophils ( Figure 7B ), 471 The CCL3L1 and CCL4L1 genes harbor several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hotspots for duplication, resulting in distinct haplotypes and copy number variations, respectively, in different individuals (24) .  The copy numbers are the highest in Africans, followed by Asians, Amerindians, Central/South Asians, Middle East individuals and Europeans (25) .  It has been suggested that because CCL3L1 is a potent ligand of CCR5, variations in copy numbers and thus their expression might influence entry of the virus.  Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Townson et al.  (26) reported that CCL3L1 occurs as two copies per diploid genome in most Caucasians (49%), although 10%-20% individuals could have one, three, or four copies.

However, we have also identified two different cells, i. e.  plasma cell and mast cell.  In case of plasma cells, all three transcripts are significantly expressed, whereas in mast cells AGT and ACE2 are significantly expressed.  Our data suggest that ADAMs are differentially expressed in DRGs and SCs.  Among all ADAMs investigated, ADAM10 seems to play a critical role in axonal outgrowth in the peripheral nerve.   The molecular species of GSLs expressed in mammalian cells vary according to cell differentiation status and pathologic processes.  Undifferentiated cells such as stem cells specifically express globo-series GSLs such as SSEA-3 and SSEA-4, whereas these GSLs disappear during differentiation of the cells into somatic cells, which then express other type of GSLs [18] .  The type of GSL expressed in a given type of cell or tissues can also differ depending on species.  For example, murine stem cells express SSEA-1 (a GSL containing Lewis X glycan) [35, 36] , whereas this GSL antigen is not expressed by human stem cells [18] .

{"ref_question": "How does the presence of DC-SIGNR affect the MTCT of HIV-1?", "ref_answers": ["the presence of DC-SIGNR at the placental endothelial cell surface may protect infants from HIV-1 infection by capturing virus and promoting its degradation/presentation. "], "answer": "2", "confidence": 0.5506, "evidence": " However, biochemical and structural studies show that they have distinct ligand-binding properties and different physiological functions.  Of importance in both these genes is the presence of an extra-cellular domain consisting of an extended neck region encoded by tandem repeats that support the CRD, which plays a crucial role in influencing the pathogen-binding properties of these receptors.  The notable difference between these two genes is in the extra-cellular domain.  Whilst the tandem-neck-repeat region remains relatively constant in size in DC-SIGN, there is considerable polymorphism in L-SIGN.  Homooligomerization of the neck region of L-SIGN has been shown to be important for high-affinity ligand binding, and heterozygous expression of the polymorphic variants of L-SIGN in which neck lengths differ could thus affect ligand-binding affinity.  Despite DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind HIV and enhance infection, comparison of these receptors reveals that they have very different physiological functions.  Given the presence of DC-SIGNR at the maternal-fetal interface and its interaction with HIV-1, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1.  To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Zimbabwe, and identified specific DC-SIGNR variants associated with increased risks of HIV transmission.  We further characterized the functional impact of these genetic variants on DC-SIGNR expression and show that they affect both the level and type of DC-SIGNR transcripts produced in the placenta.  There are now a number of studies suggesting that genetic variants in 3=-UTR affecting RNA expression can be implicated in human disease (reviewed in [32] ).  Using computerbased prediction tools (Lasergene software, DNA Stars, Madison, WI), we observed that these novel mutations are likely to modify the secondary structure of the DC-SIGNR 3=-UTR, which in turn could affect mRNA stability or production.  Further in vitro studies will be needed to assess the possible effects of these novel 5=-UTR and 3=-UTR mutations on DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR transcriptional and translational activities.  They were significant differences in the distribution of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR alleles among African and non-African populations.  Of interest, the DC-SIGN promoter variant Ϫ336G associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [18] and dengue hemorrhagic fever [19] is found significantly more frequently in African than in Caucasian or Asian populations (p Ͻ 0. 001) ( Table 1 ).  This observation is very interesting, considering the high prevalence of at least the former infection in Africa.  The Ϫ336G variant, located 214 bp upstream of the major transcription site, affects a Sp1 binding site and modulates in vitro DC-SIGN transcriptional activity by decreasing its expression [19] .  The reduced DC and macrophage cell surface expression of DC-SIGN in individuals carrying the Ϫ336G variant might have deleterious effects on clearance of pathogens by diminishing the antigen-presenting capability of these cells.  However, recent in vitro studies have shown that HIV-1 and other important pathogens target DC-SIGN to escape immune surveillance and to promote their survival [33, 34] .  Other relatively frequent promoter mutations, found exclusively in Africans, might also affect cell surface expression of DC-SIGN", "time": 5.3947497910000095}

Again, CCCD was defective in the interaction with EBOV-GP bearing pseudotypes (data not shown), suggesting that the mDC-SIGN neck prevents the interaction with virionassociated EBOV-GP.  Here, we investigated if patient derived DC-SIGNR alleles with five and six repeat units augment infection by HIV-1 and by HIV-pseudotypes bearing the envelope glycoprotein of EBOV and the spike (S) protein of SARS-coronavirus (CoV).  We report that DC-SIGNR alleles with five, six or seven repeat units bind to viral glycoproteins, enhance viral infection and form tetramers with comparable efficiency, indicating that the absence of two repeat units does not appreciably compromise DC-SIGNR interaction with pathogens.  Also, coexpression of alleles with seven and five repeat units augmented viral infectivity to levels observed upon expression of each allele alone, suggesting that under conditions of robust lectin expression the potential formation of hetero-oligomers might not reduce pathogen engagement substantially.

A phase II clinical trial assessing leronlimab in COVID-19 patients with respiratory complications was registered in April 2020 [206] .  Ibalizumab is non-immunosuppressive, FDA approved for the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV in 2018 [207] and may be considered as a co-treatment agent for COVID-19 in the future.  Host cell defenses to viral infections are based on chemokine and cytokine signals.  Pathologically overproduced chemokines and their respective receptors have been identified in patients with COVID-19.  In a landmark study, Chua et al described lung epithelium and immune cell interactions and concluded that pharmacological inhibition of either the C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1) or CCR5 pathways may restore immune homeostasis [40] .  We have examined several compounds for their inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures and found that the chemokine receptor antagonist cenicriviroc (CVC) inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2.  CVC is a C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonist with potent and selective anti-HIV-1 activity (Baba et al. , 2005) .  In addition, CVC antagonizes not only CCR5 but also C-C chemokine receptor type 2b (CCR2b).  Since CCR2b is the receptor of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), CVC exerts anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in vivo (Dawson et al. , 2003; Xia and Sui, 2009) .  In fact, CVC is currently under clinical trials for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which immune cell activation and dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in its pathogenesis (Pedrosa et al. , 2020) .  Another strategy for blocking HIV infection is to target the host's cellular factors which to date, has mainly meant targeting host cell receptors.  HIV uses C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4) as co-receptors to invade target cells.  Of note, mutations in CCR5 confer immunity to HIV in humans.  Therefore, CCR5 is an essential factor for HIV's entry and likely a good target for the treatment of HIV.  Zhou et al", "time": 21.113300334}

The greatest concern, for both protein and non-peptidic CBAs, is the degree of selectivity they may eventually show for the viral glycoproteins -that is, their potential to discriminate between pathogen (non-self) glycoproteins and cellular (self) glycoproteins.  However, the HIV envelope gp120 carries a higher proportion of high-mannosetype glycans than do mammalian glycoproteins 87 .  The three-dimensional configuration of the glycans that are displayed on the glycoproteins of the pathogen has been shown to be important, which may help the CBA to distinguish between 'non-self ' glycans of the pathogen and 'self ' glycans of the host.  High-mannose-type glycans contain terminal α(1,2)-mannose oligomers that are rare on glycans of mammalian glycoproteins.  In fact, MBL and DC-SIGN can distinguish between pathogen-derived glycoproteins and cellular glycoproteins, enabling a selective elimination of the pathogen through specific interaction with its carbohydrate configuration 65, 119 .  It is also important that the CBA can discriminate between the glycans present on commensal bacteria and the glycans that must be targeted on the viral-envelope glycoproteins.  It will be a challenging goal, but one, I believe, which is achievable, to discover or design CBAs that show a marked degree of discriminating selectivity between pathogen glycans and the glycans of the host, including the glycans of commensal bacteria.  As a component of humoral immunity and a mediator between the innate and adaptive immune response, complement can directly neutralize viruses and modulate pathogen elimination ( Fig.  1 ).

Our analysis revealed an expansion of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) gene family (PTHR13999, p=2. 18e-05) in the phyllostomids ( Figure 4 ).  IFITM genes are potent antiviral factors as they can prevent infection before a virus passes the lipid bilayer of the cell 77, 78 .  These genes belong to a group of host restriction factors, that include members of the APOBEC3 family, protecting cells from viral invasion.  Of the five human IFITM proteins, three have antiviral activity (IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3) while the other two (IFITM5 and IFITM10) have no known role in immunity 79 .  In humans, the IFITM locus consists of a ~22kb region on chromosome 11, comprising the three immune-related IFITM (IR-IFITM) genes and IFITM5.  The IFITM10 gene is ~1. 4Mb distant from the other four IFITM genes.  This IFITM5-IR-IFITM-IFITM10 structure of the IFITM locus appears conserved across most mammals 80 , with minor changes in the copy number of the IR-IFITM genes.  Many species, including humans, also have additional copies of IR-IFITM genes in genomic locations distant from the IFITM locus.  Here, we found that the IFITM locus in the three analysed phyllostomids has retained the structure of the human IFITM locus but with a substantial expansion of IR-IFITM genes (Figure 4) , likely via tandem duplication.  The phyllostomids that we investigated have 9-13 apparently functional IR-IFITM genes in regions of ~69kb to ~162kb, flanked by IFITM5 and IFITM10.

The sequences of paramyxovirus F proteins reveal the conservation not only of amino acid residues of the fusioninducing domain, cleavage site, and transmembrane domain, but also of cysteine residues at specific positions.  As shown in Fig.  1 , mature Sendai virus F o protein has 10 cysteine residues, designated Cl to C10, and the relative position of cysteine residues is highly conserved among paramyxovirus F proteins (2, 3) .  This suggests that these cysteine residues play important structural and functional roles.  Two cysteine residues are present in the signal peptide and are not likely to participate in intramolecular disulfide bonds of the mature protein.  The Cl cysteine is in the F 2 subunit, and the remaining 9 cysteine residues are in the Fi subunit.  Eight of the 9 cysteine residues are clustered in a narrow region near the transmembrane domain.  The transmembrane domain of the S protein is found in the region C-terminal of the S2 domain (Fig.  1B) .  A short cytoplasmic tail or endodomain is located at the C-terminal end of S.  It contains conserved stretches of cysteine residues, which can be palmitoylated.  Palmitoylation of cysteine residues within the endodomain was found to be important for regulating fusogenicity of S (Petit et al. , 2007; Shulla and Gallagher, 2009) .  Bioinformatic analysis of the SARS-CoV S2 domain flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833 (residues: 1163-1213), cytoplasm domain (residues: 1237-1273) [62] .

DHHC3 catalyse PD-L1 palmitoylation.  Inhibition of PD-L1 palmitoylation using 2-bromopalmitate or via DHHC3 silencing increases anti-tumour activity in cells and in mice.  These discoveries of PD-1 and PD-L1 palmitoylation and targeting for modulation of T cell immune responses in cancer provide exciting opportunities for combinatorial approaches along with immune checkpoint therapy.  In DCs, TLR2 is found to be palmitoylated on Cys609 at the cytoplasmic edge of the transmembrane domain (Chesarino et al. , 2014) .  Multiple DHHCs (DHHC 2, 3, 6, 7, 15) are responsible for the palmitoylation of TLR2.  Inhibition of TLR2 palmitoylation either by 2-BP or mutation of the palmitoylation site leads to the decreased surface expression of TLR2 in DCs, without affecting the overall protein level and stability of TLR2.  Blocking TLR2 palmitoylation also inhibits microbial ligands-induced activation of NF-κB and production of IL-6 and TNFα, which is, at least partially, due to the insufficient surface expression of TLR2.  Similar to TLR2, other TLRs (TLR5,6,10) have been shown to be palmitoylated in DCs (Chesarino et al. , 2014) .  Whether and how palmitoylation regulates their function remain to be addressed.  Phosphorylation also appears to regulate palmitoylation of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoform PDE10A2 (Charych et al. , 2010) .  The N terminus of PDE10A2 contains a palmitoylated cysteine residue (Cys11) that is essential for membrane anchoring and efficient dendritic transport in striatal neurons.  Palmitoylation was perturbed when phosphomimetic mutations were introduced into a downstream PKA phosphorylation site .  Does phosphorylation at Thr-16 actively promote depalmitoylation of Cys-11, or does it block palmitoylation of this cysteine? In fact, PKA activation markedly enhanced PDE10A2 phosphorylation but had no acute effect on membrane expression levels.  This observation suggests that phosphorylation does not promote depalmitoylation and membrane release of PDE10A2 but, instead, likely inhibits membrane binding by blocking palmitoylation.  This phosphoregulation of palmitoylation might be relevant to many palmitoylated peripheral proteins and could represent a mechanism to promote a shift toward the depalmitoylated state of a protein in the absence of active (thioesterase driven) depalmitoylation.  Negatively charged phosphate groups are likely to inhibit palmitoylation of neighboring cysteines by interfering with membrane interactions before palmitoylation (Fig", "time": 7.0942289170000095}

Our ability to image IFITM3 trafficking in live cells has not only revealed interactions with pathogens during infection but also uncovered how posttranslational modifications regulate the function of these small membrane proteins.  We initially discovered IFITM3 S-fattyacylation 14, 44 , determined endogenous levels 45 and specific sites of modification 45, 46 , as well as confirmed its modification with palmitic acid 46 .  While these results have also been confirmed by others [47] [48] [49] and also shown for IFITM5 50 , how S-palmitoylation at Cys72 regulated IFITM3 antiviral activity was unclear from steady-state localization studies.  Using site-specific fluorophore labeling and live cell imaging during infection, we now observe that inhibition of S-palmitoylation at Cys72, but not Cys71 or 105, by site-directed mutagenesis impairs IFITM3 trafficking to incoming IAV particles and thus reveals how site-specific S-palmitoylation regulates IFITM3 antiviral activity.  The chemical imaging approach described here has uncovered important aspects of how IFITMs engage pathogens during infection, as well as key regulatory mechanisms, and should facilitate the analysis of other host factors involved in pathogen restriction.

ZDHHC1 was transcriptionally up-regulated by p53 to promote IFITM3 palmitoylation and stability.  Further investigation confirmed the critical role of ZDHHC1-IFITM3 axis in mediating p53's anti-JEV effect.  Interestingly, for viral evasion, JEV reduced p53 expression to impair ZDHHC1 mediated IFITM3 palmitoylation.  Our data suggest the existence of a previously unrecognized p53-ZDHHC1-IFITM3 regulatory pathway in restricting JEV replication.

To date, the host factors which play the role against the H9N2 subtype influenza virus is still obscure.  The interferoninducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein families are activated in response to viral infections and represent a new class of cellular restriction factors that block the replication of pathogens and its pathogenesis [24] .  The average size of IFITM proteins including IFITM1-IFITM5 are 130 amino acids and share a topology defined by a conserved CD225 domain [24, 25] , consisting of two intramembrane (IM) regions and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL).  One or more IFITM proteins can be constitutively expressed in specific cells and tissues [25] , such as a wide range of human tissues expressing IFITM1-IFITM3, while IFITM5 is expressed only in osteoblasts [26] .  Potentially, this constitutive expression pattern of IFITM can provide the first line of defense against virus infection [26] .  Increasingly, reports showed that IFITM offers protection against numerous viruses, including Influenza A, Rift Valley fever virus, SARS coronavirus, filoviruses, Dengue and HIV, through several routes, including inhibiting formation of a fusion pore between the virus and endosomal membranes [26] [27] [28] [29] .  In mouse models, IFITM3 has been shown to have the most antiviral activity of the IFITM class for the viruses investigated and restricted in influenza A virus infection [30] .

The putative IFITM5 gene is located next to an uncharacterized gene (ENSGALG00000006478), with which it shares 30% amino acid identity.  Immediately adjacent to this are three sequence gaps whose estimated sizes are 1 kb, 1 kb, and 400 bp in the ENSEMBL chicken genome build.  Importantly, the putative IFITM genes in chicken are flanked by the telomeric ␤-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 4 (B4GALNT4) gene and the centromeric acid trehalase-like 1 (ATHL1) gene.  The B4GALNT4 and ATHL1 genes flank the antiviral IFITM 1, 2, -3, and -5 gene block in mammalian genomes.  Sequence similarity searches of the most recent build of the chicken genome (v4. 0, NCBI) using TBLASTN analysis and the putative IFITM5 amino acid sequence, revealed several transcripts with high amino acid identity to IFITM5.

Another unique feature of coronavirus mRNAs is that the 5'-ends of all the mRNAs, including genomic RNA, contain an identical stretch of 50-70 nucleotides:.  Precolostral sera, P-2 and P-3, were also studied by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration.  Neutralizing activity against bovine parvovirus was detected in fractions before the elution of IgG1 and in a few early fractions containing IgG1 (Fig.  3) .  This finding seems also to support the view that the sera may contain some substances, other than immunoglobulins, capable of inhibiting the growth of bovine parvovirus.  With P-2 serum, neutralizing activity against bovine coronavirus was also detected in fractions containing no immunoglobulin (Fig.  3) , while P-3 serum had neutralizing activities against bovine coronavirus and rotavirus in fractions containing IgG~ (Fig.  3) .  These discussions seem to indicate that some precolostral and fetal calf sera may contain substance(s), other than immunoglobulins, capable of inhibiting the replication of bovine parvovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus.  For further analysis of the RNA sequence of CRCV, an alignment of the RNA for the spike gene of the bovine coronavirus LY 138 strain and the human coronavirus OC43 strain was performed.  Consensus regions were chosen for the selection of four primer pairs amplifying the complete spike gene in four overlapping fragments; the primer sequences are shown in Table 1 .  The cDNA obtained from tracheal sample T101 was used to perform RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing of the obtained spike fragments.  The analysis of the sequencing data showed that the spike gene of CRCV is 4092 nucleotides long, corresponding to 1093 amino acids.

Importantly, the two topologies provide separate functions to the L protein.  Indeed, the e-preS domain is exposed on the surface of the virion and participates in virus receptor binding (Urban and Gripon, 2002) , whereas the i-preS domain is important for interaction with the nucleocapsid (Bruss, 2004) .  The envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus play a major role in virus budding.  Patients infected by this virus release subviral particles that contain predominantly the S protein with variable amounts of M and only trace quantities of L subunits (Ganem and Schneider, 2001) .  In addition, expression of S protein alone also leads to the production of subviral particles, indicating that the viral information necessary for this assembly process resides in the S domain.  These subviral particles are assembled in a pre-Golgi compartment.  The envelopment of the hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid depends on viral envelope proteins.  The S and L proteins, but not the M protein, are required for this process (Bruss, 2004) .  The nucleocapsid is incorporated into particles by interaction of the i-preS domain of the L protein.  HBV envelope protein, namely the surface antigens, plays an essential role in the infection process.  Both genetic and functional examination identified one domain in the Nterminus of HBV preS1 (amino acids 1-47) necessary for infection.  This domain has been shown to function as a direct mediator for HBV by binding presumably cellular corresponding receptor(s) [3] .  More importantly, the myristoylated peptide is shown to effectively block HBV infection in primary human hepatocytes and in the human hepatocytechimera mouse at a nanomolar concentration [4] .  In fact, a clinical trial testing the efficacy of this peptide in preventing HBV infection has been ongoing [5] .  Clearly, this preS1 peptide can be a useful probe to pull out the interacting cellular factors, including specific viral receptors.  In coronavirus, the S-proteins are anchored to the lipid envelope like a type I receptor and contains 3 domains, i. e.  a large N-terminal surface domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal domain located inside the envelope (Cavanagh, 1995) .

Herein, we briefly introduce the biological sample preparation methods for detecting different biomarkers.  The preparation methods for detecting nucleic acid, antigens, and antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 are described as follows: Particle agglutination methodologies have been employed for detecting group B streptococcal antigens in CSF or urine.  Testing of urine samples has been discouraged because the urine sample may be positive as the result of skin or genitourinary contamination, or possibly from intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of antigen.  (31) Many laboratories have discontinued antigen testing of CSF because it generally offers no better sensitivity than a properly performed Gram stain.  No rapid tests have proved sensitive enough to determine maternal colonization directly from vaginal swabs.  However, sensitive PCR test is now coming into use.  (32) 3. 4. 1. 5.  Definitive Identification.  Streptococci are classified into Lancefield groups on the basis of their cell wall carbohydrate antigens.  The classical methods of grouping employ an extraction step, usually hot acid (Lancefield method) or nitrous acid, followed by detection of liberated antigens with specific rabbit antisera.  More recently, latex and similar particle agglutination kits make it possible for any laboratory to provide rapid and accurate group identification without having to maintain serologic supplies.  Molecular methods are now replacing some of the more tedious procedures.  Two different antibody assays were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: a rapid point-of-care (POC) fingerprick assay and a laboratory-based assay.  POC test: Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit (abx294171) detecting antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S)-antigens.  Traditionally, laboratory diagnoses of medical viruses are carried out by isolating viruses in embryonated chicken eggs, in tissue culture, or in laboratory animals and visual examination of viral particles in sample using electron microscopy among others [16] .

It remains to be confirmed whether this response is long-lasting in patients who have experienced more severe disease compared with the ambulatory patients that were studied here.  Saliva analysis, potentially based on newly developed digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assays, such as the single molecule array (Simoa) (46) , may represent a convenient way to address this issue in future studies.  For the other coronaviruses, several validated and approved multiplex assays are available, such as the RespiFinder assay (Pathofinder, Maastricht, Netherlands), the film array (former IDAHO film assay, meanwhile produced and distributed by bioMerieux, Lyon, France), or the Luminex RVP (Luminex, Austin, Texas, USA).  All of these assays have the advantage of a high sensitivity combined with the simultaneous detection of several other pathogens.  Moreover, the novel Light Mix Modular Assays from Roche/TIBMOLBIOL could serve as an alternative for coronavirus diagnostics.   A multiplexed direct hybridization assay was used to genotype amplified patient DNA samples for known mutations related to a predisposition to thrombophilia [18] .  The study employed multiple technologies to determine the association between hypercoagulable states or increased platelet adhesion/aggregation and bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters.  The xMAP-based assay was used for genotyping the factor V R506Q (Leiden), factor II 20210GYA and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677CYT mutations associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism.  Recently, Bortolin et al.  described a multiplexed ASPE assay with capture onto addressed microspheres to detect these and three additional thrombophilia-associated mutations: MTHFR 1298AYC; factor XIII val34leu; and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) C536T [28] .  The assay used the Tag-Iti microsphere-based universal array platform (Tm Bioscience) which features universal, minimally cross-hybridizing sequences (tags) for capturing the reaction products by hybridization onto complementary anti-tag-coupled microspheres.  The universal array was validated using synthetic biotinylated tags as targets and showed non-specific signal to be 3. 7% of the specific signal.  A total of 132 patient DNA samples were genotyped by both the Tag-It universal array and DNA sequencing and showed 100% concordance between the two methods.   ", "time": 3.3396605000002637}

The effectiveness of the RNAi as a therapeutic agent greatly depends on the efficient delivery of siRNA to the correct intracellular location, to interact with the RNAi machinery within the target cell, within the target tissue responsible for the pathology.  Each of these levels of targeting poses a significant barrier.  Several strategies have been developed to overcome these barriers, such as chemical modifications of siRNA, viral nucleic acid delivery systems, and nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems.  The method widely used to facilitate the efficient delivery of siRNA is high-pressure intravenous (i. v. ) injection [118, 119] .  In this method, a large volume of siRNA solution is injected into the circulation in a relatively short time; this puts the recipient at risk for acute heart failure.  Also, hydrodynamic injection delivers siRNA throughout the body, thus inducing undesirable suppression of gene expression in some organs [119] .  Later on, mechanical methods like electroporation and sonoparation were developed to deliver siRNA to the target tissue [120, 121] .  Electroporation is a convenient and efficient method in which electrical shocks are applied to the membrane, producing pores, and allowing the negatively charged external molecules to enter into the cytosol by electrophoresis [120] .  Electroporation has been found useful for the intracellular delivery of siRNA to muscle [122] , brain [120] and kidney [119] .  This method requires the insertion of electrodes into the target area, thus involving invasive procedures and limiting its range of application.  Sonoporation is a method in which ultrasound is used to increase the porosity of the cell membrane to allow large molecules in the surrounding medium to enter the cell [121] .  This method has been used to deliver siRNA into whole organs like heart.  The main problem encountered by this method is its low efficiency, which needs to be addressed [119] .  Several studies have demonstrated efficient in vivo delivery of siRNA (13) (14) (15) .  The first direct delivery of siRNA in vivo was carried out using the \"hydrodynamic\" technique of administering naked siRNA in a large volume of a physiological solution, under high pressure, into the tail vein of mice.  In order to evaluate the efficacy of this delivery method, mice were co-injected with plasmids expressing the luciferase gene as a reporter along with synthetically prepared siRNA targeted to the luciferase mRNA ( Fig.  4) (41) ", "time": 5.558277957999962}

The upper airway mucosa is a main site for deposition of potentially noxious environmental molecules.  As one might expect this mucosa is also well equipped to protect both itself and the rest of the body from harmful influences of foreign material [1] .  The regulation of the permeability of nasal and tracheobronchial mucosa is such that blood plasma may enter the airway lumen without making it any easier for foreign surface molecules to penetrate into the airway tissue [2] [3] [4] .  Thus, circulating humoral defence systems would be allowed to neutralize offending stimuli on the surface of a mucosa that maintains its absorption barrier uncompromised [5] .  Mechanisms involved in the direction-selective paracellular flux of solutes across the intact airway mucosa [6, 7] are the basis for the first part of this overview.

There are several inhalation devices available for the delivery of drugs into the lungs.  Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are the most common modes of inhaled delivery.  MDIs are the most commonly used inhalers for several lung diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a spacer is an external device that is attached to an MDI to allow for better drug delivery by enhanced actuation and inhalation coordination.  For most MDIs, the propellant is one or more gases called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  Although CFCs in drugs are safe for patients to inhale, they are harmful to the environment.  Therefore, further development of inhalable siRNAs may not be the best way forward.  DPIs are devices that deliver medication to the lungs in the form of dry powder.  The use of DPIs has already shown promise for the in vivo delivery of therapeutic macromolecules such as insulin [39] and low-molecular-weight heparin [40] ; thus, it could be a better device for delivering siRNAs to the lungs.  The advantages of DPIs are improved stability and sterility of biomolecules over liquid aerosols and propellant-free formation.  We do not recommend the use of a nebulizer during the pandemic as there is an increased risk of aerosol spread of virus particles 13 .  Instead, patients should use metered dose inhalers with spacing devices, soft mist inhalers or dry powder inhalers to administer all COPD medications at home, and inside healthcare facilities and nursing homes.  Patients who are already using nebulizers at home should continue to do so until they can be switched to alternative delivery methods.  However, they should consider nebulizing their medicines in a separate room from others in the house, and implement other infection control recommendations.  Direct access to a vast array of lung-associated diseases makes the lung an ideal target for RNAi-based therapies.  With a total surface area of 140 m 2 [ 54 ] , the pulmonary route offers an attractive alternative to the invasive nature of intravenous injections.  The future clinical potential for pulmonary RNAi therapeutics holds promise based on the large number of current inhalable traditional drugs and established pulmonary delivery technologies provided by pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) or dry powder inhalers (DPIs) [ 55 ] .  The respiratory system also provides an opportunity for drugs to reach the systemic circulation by uptake across the thin epithelium of the alveoli.

The pCI-scLuc plasmid contained corresponding siSC2 and siSC5-targeted DNA sequence between its cytomegalovirus promoter-driven transcriptional initiation site and luciferase encoding sequence.  This setup allowed easy monitoring of delivery efficiency from Luc assay.  Interestingly, co-delivery in 5% glucose resulted in a higher level of reporter gene expression and stronger RNAi effect than that delivered in the INFASURF solution.  Hence the former (i. e. , naked siRNA) was employed in 5% glucose for experiments in Rhesus macaque.

Figure 8 (c) shows the comparison of the nose deposition with (after correction) and without a mask.  In contrast to the high sensitivity of the nasal DF to particle size without a mask, the nasal DF was found to be relatively independent of the particle size when wearing a mask.  On the other hand, the laryngeal DF shows high sensitivities, regardless of the presence of a mask.  These particle-size-dependent differences highlight the need for future testing of mask filtration efficiency of monodisperse aerosols.  Future estimation of infectious respiratory disease transmission and presentation should also consider these size-related discrepancies for more reliable predictions.  The surface deposition in the upper airway is shown in Fig.  8 (e) for four particle sizes (1 μm, 5 μm, 10 μm, and 20 μm) with and without a mask.  Heterogeneous particle distributions are found in all cases hereof, with high levels of particle accumulations in certain areas while no or few particles in other areas.  Note the highly different deposition patterns among the four different sized aerosols with a mask shown in the upper panel of Fig.  8(e) .  Even though the cumulative deposition in the nose may be insensitive to particle size, the local deposition can still be highly sensitive, corroborating the need to study monodisperse aerosols.  One other barrier is the size of the inhaled material [37] .  For lung delivery, the geometric diameter, particle shape and density are taken into account resulting in the so called aerodynamic diameter (AD).  The AD of the particles affects the magnitude of forces acting on them.  While inertial and gravitational effects increase with increasing particle size, diffusion produces larger displacement as particle size decreases ( Figure 2 ).  Large particles (> 5 μm AD) usually impact on airway wall at bifurcations.  They are usually deposited higher up in the airway such as the back of the throat or pharynx [38] .  When the AD of particles ranges from 1 to 5 μm, they are subject to sedimentation by gravitational force that occurs in smaller airways and respiratory bronchioles ( Figure 2 ).  The optimal particle size for efficient deposition at the lower respiratory tract is considered to be between 1 and 3 μm [39, 40] (Figure 2 )", "time": 14.347583290999864}

Expression of the downstream lacZ gene, in the +l reading frame, is unaffected by the termination codons.  We show that the frameshift event is directional and reading frame specific.  Three different constructs allow translation to occur into each of the three reading frames of the frameshift site.  For each construct, the /acZ gene is fused downstream in all three reading frames.  This allows an assay for frameshifting from each of the reading frames in either the +l or -1 direction.  Translation into the frameshift sequence in the 0, or p/A, reading frame (the normal reading frame of the frameshift site) allows wild-type levels of frameshifting in the +l direction.  However, translating the +l or -1 reading frames allows no frameshifting in the +l direction, demonstrating the reading frame specificity of frameshifting.  Frameshifting does not occur in the -1 direction from any of the three reading frames, indicating that frameshifting is directional.  Some viruses make very efficient use of their small genome size by using not just one of the three possible reading frames but two or all three reading frames.  An example is HBV, in which the polymerase and capsid protein reading frames overlap.  For treating HBV infections, the commonly used antiviral compounds are lamivudine (LMV or 3TC), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), and telbuvidine.  All these three inhibit the viral polymerase, and so resistant mutations arise in the gene coding for the polymerase.  The same mutation can, however, also change the viral surface protein due to the overlap of the reading frames.  Conversely, the immune system would exert pressure on the virus to generate mutations in the surface protein but such mutations may give rise to nonfunctional viral polymerase.

However, in our context, the rapidly changing rate of COVID-19 cases makes applying these approaches less accurate and inefficient.  In order to address the unique challenges of capacity optimization in a pandemic, we developed an approach that combines and modifies several existing techniques.  The core of our approach is an iterative search procedure to find the minimum number of ventilators required to keep the estimated loss probability from the simulation under 5%.  Our search procedure uses a stochastic root-finding method based on response surface methodology (RSM), which we describe in Subsection 3. 2. 2 and Appendix A.  Furthermore, to increase the efficiency of the search, we used an initial proximate required capacity from a pointwise stationary approximation (PSA) described in Subsection 3. 2. 1.  As a result, the availability of ventilators and ECMO machines may become a decisive factor in outcomes for many patients with severe disease.  At the time of writing, there was worldwide concern that there will be a shortfall of intensive care beds and of mechanical ventilators to support the most severe cases of COVID-19.  Estimates of the number of ventilators in the US in March 2020 ranged from 60,000 to 160,000 [28] , although the distribution of ventilators is unlikely to directly coincide with COVID-19 hotspots.

We urge three complementary avenues of action to reduce the imbalance between supply and demand for ventilators.  First, vigilant social distancing has potential to flatten the curve, 1 which will both delay and suppress the outbreak peak.  In addition to reducing the peak demand for ventilators, the delay would provide a window of opportunity to ramp up ventilator production.  Second, it is plausible that the USA will experience several asynchronous local peaks rather than one apex.  A nationalised allocation system that transfers ventilators based on state-level epidemiological projections would most efficiently capitalise on existing units", "time": 248.0302657909997}

Exhaled breath condensate-a noninvasive but complicated method.  It reflects the composition of the fluid lining the airway and successfully measures hydrogen peroxide, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, isoprostanes, nitric oxide-derived products, and hydrogen ions [55] .  However, the measurement of mediators within exhaled breath condensate is not very reproducible, and the technique warrants improvement [56] .  Other ways of indirectly assessing markers of inflammation in the lower airways have been considered, including exhaled gases and breath condensate, but they too have their limitations.  Exhaled NO (eNO) is reduced in CF (4); therefore, consideration could be given to measuring eNO in exhaled breath in a study of an anti-inflammatory drug that might impact the pathway leading to the upregulation of NO.  While investigators have measured some inflammatory mediators in exhaled breath condensate, the usefulness of these measures as outcomes remains to be defined as well.  Exhaled breath condensate is a promising source of biomarkers of lung disease in humans.  Exhaled breath condensate hydrogen peroxide concentration and pH were higher in horses with mild EA, vs.  controls (69) .  Additionally, both hydrogen peroxide and pH had a positive association with BAL neutrophil percentage, while leukotriene B-4 demonstrated a positive association with BAL eosinophil percentage.  Another study characterized the metabolomic profile of tracheal wash and exhaled breath condensate in healthy horses and those with severe EA (172) .  Higher concentrations of histamine and oxidant agents, such as glutamate, valine, leucine, and isoleucine, as well as lower levels of ascorbate, methylamine, dimethylamine and O-phosphocholine, were found in the group of severe EA, compared to healthy controls.  Breath analysis is an exciting new area with enormous diagnostic potential", "time": 11.116666125000847}

The symptom of shortness of breath was categorized based upon a severity from 0-3 scale.  0 = no shortness of breath, 1 = Shortness of breath with moderate intensity exercise, 2 = Shortness of breath while walking on flat surface, 3 = short of breath while getting dressed or performing daily activities.  Yoga originated in ancient India and includes physical, mental, and spiritual practices with an explicit emphasis on different breathing patterns.  Yogic breathing in a controlled manner known as Pranayama is one of the eight limbs of traditional yoga.  According to \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika, \" these Pranayamas have various benefits on the mind and body as a whole (Muktibodhananda, 2012) .  'Severity' of symptoms relates to duration of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
