"], "answer": "3", "confidence": 0.094, "evidence": " However, biochemical and structural studies show that they have distinct ligand-binding properties and different physiological functions.  Of importance in both these genes is the presence of an extra-cellular domain consisting of an extended neck region encoded by tandem repeats that support the CRD, which plays a crucial role in influencing the pathogen-binding properties of these receptors.  The notable difference between these two genes is in the extra-cellular domain.  Whilst the tandem-neck-repeat region remains relatively constant in size in DC-SIGN, there is considerable polymorphism in L-SIGN.  Homooligomerization of the neck region of L-SIGN has been shown to be important for high-affinity ligand binding, and heterozygous expression of the polymorphic variants of L-SIGN in which neck lengths differ could thus affect ligand-binding affinity.  Despite DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind HIV and enhance infection, comparison of these receptors reveals that they have very different physiological functions.  Given the presence of DC-SIGNR at the maternal-fetal interface and its interaction with HIV-1, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1.  To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Zimbabwe, and identified specific DC-SIGNR variants associated with increased risks of HIV transmission.  We further characterized the functional impact of these genetic variants on DC-SIGNR expression and show that they affect both the level and type of DC-SIGNR transcripts produced in the placenta.  There are now a number of studies suggesting that genetic variants in 3=-UTR affecting RNA expression can be implicated in human disease (reviewed in [32] ).  Using computerbased prediction tools (Lasergene software, DNA Stars, Madison, WI), we observed that these novel mutations are likely to modify the secondary structure of the DC-SIGNR 3=-UTR, which in turn could affect mRNA stability or production.  Further in vitro studies will be needed to assess the possible effects of these novel 5=-UTR and 3=-UTR mutations on DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR transcriptional and translational activities.  They were significant differences in the distribution of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR alleles among African and non-African populations.  Of interest, the DC-SIGN promoter variant Ϫ336G associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [18] and dengue hemorrhagic fever [19] is found significantly more frequently in African than in Caucasian or Asian populations (p Ͻ 0. 001) ( Table 1 ).  This observation is very interesting, considering the high prevalence of at least the former infection in Africa.  The Ϫ336G variant, located 214 bp upstream of the major transcription site, affects a Sp1 binding site and modulates in vitro DC-SIGN transcriptional activity by decreasing its expression [19] .  The reduced DC and macrophage cell surface expression of DC-SIGN in individuals carrying the Ϫ336G variant might have deleterious effects on clearance of pathogens by diminishing the antigen-presenting capability of these cells.  However, recent in vitro studies have shown that HIV-1 and other important pathogens target DC-SIGN to escape immune surveillance and to promote their survival [33, 34] .  Other relatively frequent promoter mutations, found exclusively in Africans, might also affect cell surface expression of DC-SIGN", "time": 5.438992374999998}

MVC binds to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and forms a significant number of non-covalent interactions, resulting in potent inhibition and infection prevention [79] .  Besides, by inhibiting CCR5, a receptor for molecules that mediate inflammation, MVC could play a beneficial role in treating the inflammatory phase of the COVID-19.  A clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of MVC in SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently recruiting patients in Spain [80] .  Two other potential mAbs are Leronlimab and Ibalizumab, both of which bind specifically to the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5).  A phase II clinical trial assessing leronlimab in COVID-19 patients with respiratory complications was registered in April 2020 [206] .  Ibalizumab is non-immunosuppressive, FDA approved for the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV in 2018 [207] and may be considered as a co-treatment agent for COVID-19 in the future.  Host cell defenses to viral infections are based on chemokine and cytokine signals.  Pathologically overproduced chemokines and their respective receptors have been identified in patients with COVID-19.  In a landmark study, Chua et al described lung epithelium and immune cell interactions and concluded that pharmacological inhibition of either the C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1) or CCR5 pathways may restore immune homeostasis [40] .  We have examined several compounds for their inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures and found that the chemokine receptor antagonist cenicriviroc (CVC) inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2.  CVC is a C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonist with potent and selective anti-HIV-1 activity (Baba et al. , 2005) .  In addition, CVC antagonizes not only CCR5 but also C-C chemokine receptor type 2b (CCR2b).  Since CCR2b is the receptor of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), CVC exerts anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in vivo (Dawson et al. , 2003; Xia and Sui, 2009) .  In fact, CVC is currently under clinical trials for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which immune cell activation and dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in its pathogenesis (Pedrosa et al. , 2020) .  Another strategy for blocking HIV infection is to target the host's cellular factors which to date, has mainly meant targeting host cell receptors.  HIV uses C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4) as co-receptors to invade target cells", "time": 21.540889291999974}

The two loci can be used as good markers to trace the evolutionary history of IFITM family.  They are located in two different chromosomes in lower aquatic vertebrates, and evolved to lie in one chromosome by chromosomal fusion in higher mammals (Fig.  4A) .  The syntenic relationship of IR-IFITM genes and the presence of more IR-IFITM genes in mammals than other vertebrates suggest that IR-IFITM gene sub-family experienced a rapid expansion via tandem duplication during evolution from lower vertebrates to mammals.  We further investigated changes in gene families in the noctilionid bat superfamily, including Pteronotus mesoamericanus and the phyllostomids Artibeus jamaicensis, Desmodus rotundus and Phyllostomus discolor.  Our analysis revealed an expansion of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) gene family (PTHR13999, p=2. 18e-05) in the phyllostomids ( Figure 4 ).  IFITM genes are potent antiviral factors as they can prevent infection before a virus passes the lipid bilayer of the cell 77, 78 .  These genes belong to a group of host restriction factors, that include members of the APOBEC3 family, protecting cells from viral invasion.  Of the five human IFITM proteins, three have antiviral activity (IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3) while the other two (IFITM5 and IFITM10) have no known role in immunity 79 .  In humans, the IFITM locus consists of a ~22kb region on chromosome 11, comprising the three immune-related IFITM (IR-IFITM) genes and IFITM5.  The IFITM10 gene is ~1. 4Mb distant from the other four IFITM genes.  This IFITM5-IR-IFITM-IFITM10 structure of the IFITM locus appears conserved across most mammals 80 , with minor changes in the copy number of the IR-IFITM genes.  Many species, including humans, also have additional copies of IR-IFITM genes in genomic locations distant from the IFITM locus.  Here, we found that the IFITM locus in the three analysed phyllostomids has retained the structure of the human IFITM locus but with a substantial expansion of IR-IFITM genes (Figure 4) , likely via tandem duplication.  The phyllostomids that we investigated have 9-13 apparently functional IR-IFITM genes in regions of ~69kb to ~162kb, flanked by IFITM5 and IFITM10.

The sequences of paramyxovirus F proteins reveal the conservation not only of amino acid residues of the fusioninducing domain, cleavage site, and transmembrane domain, but also of cysteine residues at specific positions.  As shown in Fig.  1 , mature Sendai virus F o protein has 10 cysteine residues, designated Cl to C10, and the relative position of cysteine residues is highly conserved among paramyxovirus F proteins (2, 3) .  This suggests that these cysteine residues play important structural and functional roles.  Two cysteine residues are present in the signal peptide and are not likely to participate in intramolecular disulfide bonds of the mature protein.  The Cl cysteine is in the F 2 subunit, and the remaining 9 cysteine residues are in the Fi subunit.  Eight of the 9 cysteine residues are clustered in a narrow region near the transmembrane domain.  The transmembrane domain of the S protein is found in the region C-terminal of the S2 domain (Fig.  1B) .  A short cytoplasmic tail or endodomain is located at the C-terminal end of S.  It contains conserved stretches of cysteine residues, which can be palmitoylated.  Palmitoylation of cysteine residues within the endodomain was found to be important for regulating fusogenicity of S (Petit et al. , 2007; Shulla and Gallagher, 2009) .

Adhesion molecules, such as selectins and integrins, work cooperatively to regulate neutrophil recruitment.  Although little is known about palmitoylation of adhesion molecules expressed on the neutrophil surface, it has been seen in many cells and cell fragments that directly interact with neutrophils.  For instance, in ECs, PECAM-1 is palmitoylated by DHHC21, and knockdown of DHHC21 greatly reduces the protein level of PECAM-1 and decreases its surface expression (Marin et al. , 2012) .  Another study reports that palmitoylation of PECAM-1 at Cys595 is required for its lipid raft localization (Sardjono et al. , 2006) .  Additionally, P-selectin in platelets mediates the formation of the platelet-neutrophil complex via binding to its ligand PSGL-1 on neutrophils, a process that aids the firm adhesion of neutrophils to activated ECs and thereby promotes leukocyte transmigration (Lisman, 2018) .  Recent studies have shown that P-selectin undergoes palmitoylation in platelets and that de-palmitoylation of P-selectin by APT1 greatly inhibits the expression of P-selection in platelets (Sim et al. , 2007) .  It is plausible that this palmitoylation-regulated P-selectin change in platelets may affect neutrophil recruitment.  S-palmitoylation of scavenger receptor CD36 has also been well studied.  CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor expressed on immune cells including monocytes, macrophages and other cell types, such as adipocytes and cardiac myocytes.  CD36 binds to and mediates uptake of oxidized phospholipids, oxidized lipoproteins and long-chain fatty acids, thus playing a major role in lipid homeostasis in cells.  In addition, CD36 plays an important role as an innate immune sensor that can recognize and bind to bacterial cell wall components, erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum and apoptotic cells.  S-palmitoylation of CD36 by DHHC4 and DHHC5 was shown to play a regulatory role in adipose tissue fatty acid uptake in mice [66] .  Binding of S-palmitoylated CD36 to fatty acids activates the kinase Lyn.  Activated Lyn phosphorylates DHHC5 and inhibits its S-palmitoylation activity.  Depalmitoylation of fatty acid bound CD36 by APT1 leads to downstream signalling to initiate endocytosis of fatty acids", "time": 6.727927665999971}

While these results have also been confirmed by others [47] [48] [49] and also shown for IFITM5 50 , how S-palmitoylation at Cys72 regulated IFITM3 antiviral activity was unclear from steady-state localization studies.  Using site-specific fluorophore labeling and live cell imaging during infection, we now observe that inhibition of S-palmitoylation at Cys72, but not Cys71 or 105, by site-directed mutagenesis impairs IFITM3 trafficking to incoming IAV particles and thus reveals how site-specific S-palmitoylation regulates IFITM3 antiviral activity.  The chemical imaging approach described here has uncovered important aspects of how IFITMs engage pathogens during infection, as well as key regulatory mechanisms, and should facilitate the analysis of other host factors involved in pathogen restriction.

As described above in the Introduction, previous studies have revealed that IFITM5 also contributes to bone formation [18] [19] [20] [21] .  Therefore, we investigated the influence of Spalmitoylation on the bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells, in which native IFITM5 is expressed.  Figure 5 shows the time-dependent nodule formation in the absence and the presence of 2BP ( Figure 5-A and -B) .  Figure 5 -C shows the results of the control trial to verify the effect of DMSO, which was used as the solvent for 2BP, on the nodule formation.  The mineralized nodule was stained with Alizarin Red, which reacts with deposited calcium.  In Figure 5 -D, the area of the mineralized nodule was plotted against experimental time.  In the absence of 2BP (Figure 5-A, -C, and -D) , the mineralization was started 15 days after the initiation of the cell differentiation (Day 0).  On the other hand, in the presence of 2BP ( Figure 5-B and -D) , the nodule was formed on Day 12.  The halftime for the maximum mineralization in the presence of 2BP was estimated to be 7 days earlier than that in the absence of 2BP (Figure 5-D) .  In addition, differences in the form of the mineralized nodules were observed.  Figure 5 -E shows an enlarged view of each nodule on Day 21.  The stained nodules were diffused in the presence of 2BP (panel b), whereas in the absence of 2BP the nodules formed a large cluster (panels a and c).  Therefore, our observations in this study suggested that the S-palmitoylation affects the bone nodule formation in the osteoblast cells.  Therefore, we concluded that the IFITM5 expressed in the native osteoblast cells is S-palmitoylated.  In addition, the bands corresponding to the high and the low molecular-mass forms shown in western blot analysis were tentatively assigned to the S-palmitoylated and the depalmitoylated forms, respectively", "time": 5.313300416999994}

To date, the host factors which play the role against the H9N2 subtype influenza virus is still obscure.  The interferoninducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein families are activated in response to viral infections and represent a new class of cellular restriction factors that block the replication of pathogens and its pathogenesis [24] .  The average size of IFITM proteins including IFITM1-IFITM5 are 130 amino acids and share a topology defined by a conserved CD225 domain [24, 25] , consisting of two intramembrane (IM) regions and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL).  One or more IFITM proteins can be constitutively expressed in specific cells and tissues [25] , such as a wide range of human tissues expressing IFITM1-IFITM3, while IFITM5 is expressed only in osteoblasts [26] .  Potentially, this constitutive expression pattern of IFITM can provide the first line of defense against virus infection [26] .  Increasingly, reports showed that IFITM offers protection against numerous viruses, including Influenza A, Rift Valley fever virus, SARS coronavirus, filoviruses, Dengue and HIV, through several routes, including inhibiting formation of a fusion pore between the virus and endosomal membranes [26] [27] [28] [29] .  In mouse models, IFITM3 has been shown to have the most antiviral activity of the IFITM class for the viruses investigated and restricted in influenza A virus infection [30] .  IFITM1 also showed antiviral activity against Influenza A and hepatitis C virus [31, 32] .

Amino acid identity comparison of PoIFITM1 with other known IFITM proteins.  The chicken genome (ENSEMBL browser, version 2. 1) contains two putative IFITM genes on chromosome 5, the so-called IFITM5 (ENSGALG00000004239; chromosome 5:1620304 to 1621805:1) and IFITM10 (ENSGAL G00000020497; chromosome 5:15244061 to 15249351:1).  The putative IFITM5 gene is located next to an uncharacterized gene (ENSGALG00000006478), with which it shares 30% amino acid identity.  Immediately adjacent to this are three sequence gaps whose estimated sizes are 1 kb, 1 kb, and 400 bp in the ENSEMBL chicken genome build.  Importantly, the putative IFITM genes in chicken are flanked by the telomeric ␤-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 4 (B4GALNT4) gene and the centromeric acid trehalase-like 1 (ATHL1) gene.  The B4GALNT4 and ATHL1 genes flank the antiviral IFITM 1, 2, -3, and -5 gene block in mammalian genomes.  Sequence similarity searches of the most recent build of the chicken genome (v4. 0, NCBI) using TBLASTN analysis and the putative IFITM5 amino acid sequence, revealed several transcripts with high amino acid identity to IFITM5.  Additionally, BLAST hits were also identified to putative genes LOC770612 and LOC422993, within the locus flanked by B4GALNT4 and ATHL1", "time": 67.46977675000005}

In summary, we have shown that HCoV is a significant cause of ILI among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults presenting for medical evaluation.  Although there were differences in species distribution by age group, we did not detect any differences between species with respect to the clinical spectrum of disease.  Viruses and proteobacteria have been implicated in causing round pneumonia in adolescents and young adults.  During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, Wan et al.  [6] reported eight cases of SARS presenting as round pneumonias.  Likewise, there are reports of Q fever presenting in adolescents and young adults as multiple round pneumonias [20] [21] [22] [23] .

CsA Blocked HBV Infection Through Targeting NTCP.  Recently, NTCP was reported as a candidate entry receptor for HBV.  22 A transporter activity assay showed that CsA inhibited the activity of NTCP both in 293 (Fig.  5A) and HepG2 cells (Fig.  5B ) engineered to stably overexpress NTCP, as previously reported.  35 CsA was also suggested to bind to NTCP on the membrane in a ligand binding assay using HepG2-NTCP cells (Fig.  S2) .  In this study, we generated iNTCP cells, which have high NTCP expression and high susceptibility to HBV infection, and also developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes cell-surface NTCP.  Using these tools, we identified glabridin as a compound that inhibits HBV infection by downregulating levels of its entry receptor, NTCP.  Although primary hepatocytes express NTCP at low levels for the uptake of bile acids, endogenous NTCP in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines is not sufficient to achieve successful infection with HBV in vitro.  To overcome these issues, we created the iNTCP cell line, featuring inducible NTCP expression, using the third-generation tetracyclineinducible gene expression system in HepG2 cells.  Upon transient treatment with tetracycline derivatives, this cell line exhibits high expression of cell-surface NTCP and becomes highly susceptible to HBV infection without any observable cell cycle arrest.  This unique feature of our newly developed cell line makes it a useful tool for further biological analysis of NTCP in hepatic cells.  As other examples, compounds known to be NTCP inhibitors, including progesterone, propranolol and bosentan, have been shown to block HBV infection (Figure 1 ) [42] .  NTCP substrates, such as taurocholate, tauroursodeoxycholate and bromosulfophthalein, also inhibited HBV infection [38, 42, 68 ].  An anticholesteremic drug, ezetimibe, has been shown to block HBV entry [82] , and this drug was reported to inhibit the NTCP transporter [83] .  These results indicate that compounds modulating NTCP function could substantially inhibit HBV infection.  HepG2 cells engineered to overexpress NTCP are also useful for high-throughput screening to identify compounds targeting NTCP and inhibiting HBV infection.

Our data suggest that certain compounds can inhibit HBV entry without significantly affecting the transporter function of NTCP.  So far it was suggested that molecular determinants of NTCP critical for HBV entry overlap with those required for bile acid transport.  To further confirm whether the function for bile acid transport and the capacity to support HBV entry can be distinguishable, we searched for compounds that bind NTCP and inhibit its function as a bile acid transporter but cannot inhibit HBV infection.

By detecting viral antigens directly in patient specimens, either by fluorescent antibody methods or enzyme immunoassay-based techniques, it was possible to obtain a result within a clinically useful time period.  Antigen-detection tests remain an important tool in viral diagnostics; however, this method also has shortcomings, with some methods having poor sensitivity for some viral targets, particularly in adult populations.

The linear response of both biomarkers was in the 1. 0-40 ng/mL concentration range and the detection limits were 0. 3 ng/mL for CEA and 0. 4 ng/mL for PSA [50] .  The spotting concentration of the capture antibodies varied from 0. 2 to 0. 0125 mg/ml (each was serially diluted 2-fold).  The efficacy of the spotting concentration of the capture antibodies was evaluated by virus culture detection, the proper spotting concentration was determined by a combination of minimized cross reaction and higher signal intensity.  Figure 1 illustrates the array layout and Figure 2 demonstrates the result of the three spotting buffers and spot concentration of antibody 2B5 by TBE virus culture detection.  Cross reaction detection was also conducted by applying JEV, YF, and DV cultures.  The sensitivity of a new diagnostic technology essentially determines its continued existence.  Fluorescence-based assays for the detection of proteins are generally of limited sensitivity in the range of ng/mL [17] .  Lower sensitivity limits are achievable with enzyme linked or radiometric detection methods.  Typical antibody titers in blood sera lie, depending on the immunization state, in the range of ng/ mL-mg/mL [18] .  Moreover, antibodies exhibit individual affinities, which have additional effects on their detection limit.  We assessed the sensitivity of the peptide microarray with serial dilutions of antibodies in PBS buffer and diluted human serum.

Keywords like \"alcohol\", \"health\", \"HIV\", \"obesity\", \"physical activity\", or \"prevention\" reflect the medical aspects that concern people.  Finally, keywords like \"smartphone\", \"social support\", or \"text messaging\" reflect how eHealth has the potential to allow people to access community support.  DJ Halli consists of two wards (administrative blocks), each of which was further divided into four clusters for sampling purposes.  A kiosk was set up in one of the trusted community spaces in each cluster.  Our community health workers invited people (adults ⩾18 years) from houses to give blood samples.  If a household refused to participate, then the next house was approached.  The B series of scenarios uses simple random sampling in the general population, regardless of symptoms, to select individual agents for testing.  If a selected agent tests positive, they are isolated with complete efficacy for two weeks.  The C series uses cluster sampling on communities.  The same proportion of each community is selected for testing.  Once the community proportion is calculated, individual agents from each community are randomly selected for testing.  The D series uses cluster sampling on schools.  The same proportion of each school is selected for testing, except in cases where schools are small, in which case at least one student is selected from each school.  Because the D series concentrates on schools, only school-aged agents are selected for testing and adults are never selected.  The E series uses pooled sampling with pools of two people each.  All agents are placed into pools of two people with others in their community.  Pools are randomly sampled from the population for testing", "time": 64.83393124999975}

Cysteine-protease inhibitors (CPI) have gained considerable attention over the last couple of decades and many classes of compounds are currently in human clinical trials for a number of diseases.  Interest in papain family cysteine proteases as chemotherapeutic targets is derived from the recognition that they are critical to the life cycle or pathogenicity of many microorganisms.  The cysteine proteases from Streptococcus sp.  (streptopain) [1] , Staphylococcus sp.  (staphopain) [2] , Plasmodium falciparum (falcipain-1, -2, and -3) and Trypanosoma cruzi (cruzipain) [3] are some of the most widely studied members of papain family which have been reported to be linked with severity of infection and various pathological conditions caused by these microorganisms.  In summary, the results of the present study have established that 1-substituted pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives could be candidate for novel and potent inhibitors of papain like cysteine proteases, which play deleterious role in the progression of different diseases caused by diverse microorganisms.

{"ref_question": "What size of particle has been shown to be most effective in the delivery to the lower airway?", "ref_answers": ["1-5 μm"], "answer": "between 1 and 3 μm", "confidence": 0.4766, "evidence": " It is clear that wearing a mask not only changes the overall DF in the upper airway but also the DF distribution among the four regions.  Figure 8 (c) shows the comparison of the nose deposition with (after correction) and without a mask.  In contrast to the high sensitivity of the nasal DF to particle size without a mask, the nasal DF was found to be relatively independent of the particle size when wearing a mask.  On the other hand, the laryngeal DF shows high sensitivities, regardless of the presence of a mask.  These particle-size-dependent differences highlight the need for future testing of mask filtration efficiency of monodisperse aerosols.  Future estimation of infectious respiratory disease transmission and presentation should also consider these size-related discrepancies for more reliable predictions.  The surface deposition in the upper airway is shown in Fig.  8 (e) for four particle sizes (1 μm, 5 μm, 10 μm, and 20 μm) with and without a mask.  Heterogeneous particle distributions are found in all cases hereof, with high levels of particle accumulations in certain areas while no or few particles in other areas.  Note the highly different deposition patterns among the four different sized aerosols with a mask shown in the upper panel of Fig.  8(e) .  Even though the cumulative deposition in the nose may be insensitive to particle size, the local deposition can still be highly sensitive, corroborating the need to study monodisperse aerosols.  One other barrier is the size of the inhaled material [37] .  For lung delivery, the geometric diameter, particle shape and density are taken into account resulting in the so called aerodynamic diameter (AD).  The AD of the particles affects the magnitude of forces acting on them.  While inertial and gravitational effects increase with increasing particle size, diffusion produces larger displacement as particle size decreases ( Figure 2 ).  Large particles (> 5 μm AD) usually impact on airway wall at bifurcations.  They are usually deposited higher up in the airway such as the back of the throat or pharynx [38] .  When the AD of particles ranges from 1 to 5 μm, they are subject to sedimentation by gravitational force that occurs in smaller airways and respiratory bronchioles ( Figure 2 ).  The optimal particle size for efficient deposition at the lower respiratory tract is considered to be between 1 and 3 μm [39, 40] (Figure 2 )", "time": 9.591484832999868}

No biological effects have been reported when naked siRNA (1 µg/eye) was administered by intravitreous injection in rats .  Few studies report gene silencing effects following local administration, although some of the tested RNAs were slightly chemically modified (i. e.  dTdT overhangs).  Intrathracheal administration of naked (but slightly modified, dTdT) siRNA was effective through gene silencing effects in a mouse model of haemorrhagic shock and sepsis (Perl et al. , 2005) .  In non-human primates, naked (but slightly modified, dTdT) and unformulated siRNA administered intranasally was effective in severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS coronavirus infection reducing viral load and host symptoms (Li et al. , 2005) .  The hybrid system demonstrated more effective gene-silencing effects in the lung of healthy mice compared with the unmodified polymer system.  Guan et al.  developed a multimodular synthetic peptide with anchor, cationic, and targeting moieties that can form complexes with biocompatible poloxamine-based copolymers and mRNA via self-assembly [65] (Table 1) .  These ternary complexes showed excellent mRNA expression in the lungs of mice with CF with negligible toxicity, making them an attractive gene delivery system for CF and other lung diseases.  Gene silencing with RNA interference (RNAi) is a new breakthrough technology with high potential for development of therapeutics.  Here, the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells is of key importance in elucidating gene and protein function.  Differing types of interfering RNAs and several methods of delivery into cell types exist.  All require transfection optimization, as the efficiency of transfection can be affected by many factors.  Furthermore, the selection of the best silencing sequence at optimized siRNA transfection conditions is based on the integrity and purity of siRNA, siRNA uptake and cell viability.  Given the complexity of monitoring and optimizing these types of experiments a new tool is required that would allow for minimal sample and reagent consumption in a fast and easy to use format.

The main subject of attack rate is Do Scales of the Cichlid in Lake Tanganyika Function as a Morphological Defense Against Scale-Eating?.   To solve this question, it is necessary to build upon the numbers presented in the table.  Variables of interest include the attack rate % (number of ill/total number), the attack rate difference (attack rate in exposed 2 attack rate in unexposed), and the attack rate ratio (attack rate in exposed/attack rate in unexposed).  Burgers have the highest attack rate %, attack rate difference and attack rate ratio, making them the most likely source of the diarrheal illness.   The major difference between the 25% attack rate and the 15% attack rate is the magnitude of the inoperability levels.  While the 15% attack rate peaked around 14% inoperability, the 25% attack rate peaks around 24% inoperability for the highest sector.  This means that, for an increase of 10% attack rate, we see an increase of 9% in the peak inoperability.  An epidemic curve was drawn based on the daily number of cases (Y-axis) and the onset date (X-axis).  The daily attack rate was defined as the number of COVID-19 cases per day per 10 6 people (/10 6 ).  To carry out spatiotemporal analysis, the district location of each case at the time of onset was used to draw a colour map.  A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the average daily new cases and attack rates of COVID-19 between in and outside Wuhan in different periods.  The global spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 attack rates was explored by Moran's I test.  Local Indicators of Spatial Association were generated to determine the location of spatial clusters of districts with similar COVID-19 attack rates.

Eight (4%) SR patients died in CCR (study 93: 6 patients = 3%).  Results in HR patients were also similar to those of the previous study.  We estimate that 4% of patients become off study drug per year.  In the DAPA-HF trial (39), 11 % of study subjects were off study drug after an average 18 month follow-up, corresponding to 7% of patients off study drug per year.  In the PARADIGM-HF trial (38) , after 27 month average follow-up, 19% of patients were off study drug, i. e.  8 % off study drug per year.  It is possible that our estimate is too low.  However, the average follow-up in our study is at least 4 years.  The proportion of patients becoming off study drug is expected to decline during the study period.  In comparison, the SEAS study (40) with an average follow-up period of 4. 3 years had a 19% of patients off study drug, corresponding to 4 % of patients off study drug per year.

The symptom of shortness of breath was categorized based upon a severity from 0-3 scale.  0 = no shortness of breath, 1 = Shortness of breath with moderate intensity exercise, 2 = Shortness of breath while walking on flat surface, 3 = short of breath while getting dressed or performing daily activities.  Yoga originated in ancient India and includes physical, mental, and spiritual practices with an explicit emphasis on different breathing patterns.  Yogic breathing in a controlled manner known as Pranayama is one of the eight limbs of traditional yoga.  According to \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika, \" these Pranayamas have various benefits on the mind and body as a whole (Muktibodhananda, 2012) .  'Severity' of symptoms relates to duration of fever, cough and shortness of breath.

The RT-PCR can be performed as a single or two-step process.  In the one-step configuration, reverse transcription and PCR amplification are conducted in a single reaction.  This approach has significant advantages by providing speedy and reproducible outcomes for highthroughput analysis.  The limitation pertains to reverse transcription and amplification optimization owing to their simultaneous conduct, generating a lower target amplicon.  In contrast, the two-step model involves sequential reverse 4 T.  K.  MUKHERJEE ET AL.
